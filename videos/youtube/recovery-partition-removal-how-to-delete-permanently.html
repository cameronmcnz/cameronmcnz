<h2>Before you do anything</h2>
<p>Yes you can delete a recovery partition and yes you will get back a few gigabytes of precious storage space. No you should not wing this without a backup and a recovery USB. This tutorial covers safe recovery partition removal on Windows using Disk Management and diskpart while avoiding the usual facepalm moments.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Recovery partitions are handy when Windows breaks. They are also tiny vaults of wasted space when you already have a recovery USB or cloud backups. If you want free disk space and you have a plan for system recovery then deleting that recovery partition is a reasonable move. This is a tutorial for permanent deletion done carefully.</p>

<h2>Step 1 backup and create recovery media</h2>
<p>Do not skip this. Make a full user data backup and create a Windows recovery drive on a USB stick. If anything goes sideways you will be very glad you did this. Creating a recovery USB is the insurance policy you will need for system recovery.</p>

<h2>Step 2 identify the recovery partition</h2>
<p>Open Disk Management and look for a small partition labelled Recovery or with no drive letter. If you prefer the command line open an elevated command prompt and use diskpart. In diskpart list disks and partitions until you find the right one.</p>

<pre><code>diskpart
list disk
select disk N
list partition
</code></pre>

<p>Look for the small partition that says Recovery or has no letter. Note the partition number. Be sure this is the recovery partition and not a system reserved or OEM partition that your machine actually needs.</p>

<h2>Step 3 delete the partition with diskpart</h2>
<p>When you are absolutely sure you have the correct partition number remove it with diskpart. The override flag forces deletion of protected partitions so pay attention to the number you select. This is permanent deletion so no regrets later.</p>

<pre><code>select partition X
delete partition override
exit
</code></pre>

<p>Replace X with the partition number you identified. If diskpart refuses or the partition is marked as system stop and review your recovery plan. You do not want to delete a partition that Windows needs to boot.</p>

<h2>Step 4 reclaim the freed space</h2>
<p>After deletion the space will be unallocated. You have two sensible choices. Use Disk Management to extend an adjacent partition to absorb the space or leave the area unallocated for a new volume. Extending the system partition may require a reboot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open Disk Management</li>
  <li>Right click the adjacent volume and choose Extend Volume to absorb the unallocated space</li>
  <li>Or create a new partition if you prefer to keep it separate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5 verify system recovery</h2>
<p>Reboot the machine normally and confirm Windows starts without drama. Test the recovery USB you made earlier to make sure system recovery works. If something fails use the recovery USB to repair the installation. That is what you made it for.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If diskpart will not delete the partition double check you are not targeting a required system partition</li>
  <li>If Disk Management will not extend the partition consider moving partitions with reputable third party tools or back up and reinstall with a new layout</li>
  <li>If the machine will not boot use the recovery USB to run startup repair</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick recap</h2>
<p>Backup first then identify the recovery partition using Disk Management or diskpart. Use diskpart with select partition and delete partition override to remove the recovery partition permanently. Reclaim the space by extending a volume or creating a new one and verify system recovery with your USB. Follow these steps and you will get free disk space without the melodramatic recovery party later.</p>
