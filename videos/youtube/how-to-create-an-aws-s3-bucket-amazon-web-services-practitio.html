<h2>Open the AWS Management Console and go to S3</h2>
<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of cloud storage. Sign in with an account that can create S3 buckets so you do not get greeted by angry error messages. The console is the fastest path for people who prefer clicking over spelunking through APIs. This guide works for AWS Practitioner exam prep and real world deployments alike.</p>

<h3>Start bucket creation and pick a name and region</h3>
<p>Bucket names must be globally unique and lowercase. No spaces, no drama. Pick a name that will not collide with someone else on the entire planet. Choose a region that matches latency needs and compliance rules for your project or exam scenario. Wrong region means slower access and bonus points for regret.</p>

<h3>Configure options</h3>
<p>Use the options screen to harden and label your bucket. A few sensible defaults are worth more than a heroic sprint later.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable versioning for simple protection against accidental deletes and suffer less crying later.</li>
  <li>Turn on default server side encryption to keep data at rest safe and to make auditors mildly pleased.</li>
  <li>Add tags to label the bucket by environment and owner so billing and operations teams can find someone to blame.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Set permissions and block public access</h3>
<p>Keep block public access enabled unless you actually intend to host a public website. Most production buckets should have public access blocked by default. Apply least privilege policies to IAM roles and users and test access with a nonadmin principal to confirm permission boundaries. If you need buckets that serve objects to the public then use a precise bucket policy or presigned URLs rather than opening everything to the world.</p>

<h3>Review settings and create the bucket</h3>
<p>Scan your configuration checklist for name, region, versioning, encryption and access controls. Create the bucket and watch for the success notification. Confirm the new entry shows up in the console so you can stop worrying and start uploading.</p>

<h2>Exam friendly checklist and quick tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Block public access by default for most use cases.</li>
  <li>Enable versioning for accidental delete protection.</li>
  <li>Turn on server side encryption for data at rest.</li>
  <li>Use tags for environment and owner to help cost allocation and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Test permissions with a nonadmin user to verify least privilege.</li>
  <li>Pick a region that satisfies latency and compliance needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will have an S3 bucket that survives both exam questions and the real world. If you want extra credit on an AWS Practitioner or Solution Architect style exam then mention versioning, default encryption and blocking public access when you explain your design. Now go create buckets and do slightly less data tragedy than before.
