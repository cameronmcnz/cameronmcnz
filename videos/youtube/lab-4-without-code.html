  <h2>Quick reality check</h2>
  <p>If writing code makes you break into a cold sweat you are not alone. This guide shows how to finish Lab 4 using only GUI tools and careful configuration. Same objectives, fewer keystrokes, and just enough nerd flair to keep graders impressed.</p>

  <h2>What you must do first</h2>
  <p>Read the objectives and study the topology like your grade depends on it. It does. The lab objectives tell you what to capture and what counts as evidence. Skipping this turns the exercise into a guessing game where the only winner is regret.</p>

  <h3>Scan the network diagram and task list</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Note which hosts need services and which paths traffic should take.</li>
    <li>Mark expected ports and protocols to filter during packet capture.</li>
    <li>Write a one line goal for each objective so you can prove it later.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Know the GUI like a friendly saboteur</h2>
  <p>Click around, but do it with a plan. Find configuration panels, the packet capture tool, and the log export buttons. GUI labs hide the same options a CLI would offer, just wrapped in dropdowns and toggles that pretend to be helpful.</p>

  <h3>Where the useful buttons live</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Configuration forms for services and interfaces.</li>
    <li>Live logs view and download or export links for evidence.</li>
    <li>Packet capture tool with export to pcap or save as file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Configure services using the graphical interface</h2>
  <p>Populate form fields, pick values from dropdowns, flip toggles. Match the expected values from the lab instructions. If the lab wanted code it would say so, but most times the GUI gives the same knobs and buttons you need.</p>

  <h3>Practical tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Take a screenshot of each configured screen. Screenshots are cheap and persuasive.</li>
    <li>Use descriptive names for hosts and interfaces if the lab allows it so captures are easy to filter.</li>
    <li>If a setting is unclear check any inline help or the lab notes before guessing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Capture and analyze traffic for proof points</h2>
  <p>Packet capture is the evidence that says you actually did something useful. Use the built in capture tool or export logs to a pcap and open it in your favorite analyzer.</p>

  <h3>Filtering like a pro</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Filter by host and port to remove noise from the capture.</li>
    <li>Apply timestamps and annotate packets that show the expected behavior.</li>
    <li>Export a trimmed pcap that only contains the flows you reference in your report.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validate outcomes and assemble documentation</h2>
  <p>Validation is not happy luck. Reproduce the behavior for each objective and collect artifacts. A tidy bundle of screenshots logs and pcaps will save you from frantic explanations later.</p>

  <h3>What to include in your report</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A short statement of the goal for each objective.</li>
    <li>The actions you performed in the GUI with timestamps.</li>
    <li>Key artifacts such as screenshots exported logs and filtered pcaps.</li>
    <li>A brief explanation of observed results and why they meet the objective.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Final checklist before you submit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Objectives read and annotated.</li>
    <li>Services configured in the GUI with screenshots.</li>
    <li>Relevant traffic captured and filtered.</li>
    <li>Validation steps reproduced and logged.</li>
    <li>Artifacts labeled and packaged neatly for the grader.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Follow this workflow and you will finish Lab 4 without writing code while still producing reliable evidence. If anything goes sideways you can always blame a mysterious UI bug and then fix it properly for extra credit.</p>
