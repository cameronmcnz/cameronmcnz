  <h1>Using global and local Sass variables for scalable stylesheet architecture</h1>
  <p>If you enjoy hunting down stray hex codes at 2 AM then skip this article now. If you prefer not to cry over typography changes then read on. Sass variables are the boring weapon that makes your SCSS readable and your CSS predictable. They stop you from repeating values and save you from hexadecimal fatigue in the long run.</p>

  <h2>Declare variables with clear names</h2>
  <p>Pick names that tell the future you what the value is for. Avoid cryptic tokens that only your past self understands. In examples below I use an equals sign to keep the examples readable and avoid muddying prose with punctuation. These examples are pseudo code that show intent not exact syntax of the preprocessor.</p>
  <pre><code>$primary-color = #3498db
$base-spacing = 1rem
$font-size = 16px</code></pre>
  <p>In real SCSS you write the property or variable with a colon and end rules in the normal way. The examples above match the idea while staying easy on the eyes.</p>

  <h2>Use variables inside rules to avoid repetition</h2>
  <p>Drop variables into your declarations so global changes become one line edits. That is, change a theme or brand color in one place and watch the rest of your stylesheet behave itself.</p>
  <pre><code>button {
  color = $primary-color
  padding = $base-spacing
  font-size = $font-size
}</code></pre>

  <h3>Why this matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistency across components and pages</li>
    <li>Faster theme swaps and fewer regressions</li>
    <li>Less time squinting at hex values that look identical in fluorescent light</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Override values and use default fallbacks</h2>
  <p>Sometimes components need to tweak tokens without touching global files. Sass offers a default trick so you can provide a fallback but allow other files to override. In pseudo code it looks like this</p>
  <pre><code>$font-size = 16px !default</code></pre>
  <p>That little bang default flag lets a higher level file set the value first and your local file fall back to it if nothing else was provided. That pattern is great for themes and component libraries.</p>

  <h2>Understand scope and nesting</h2>
  <p>Variables declared at the top level act like global tokens and are available after they are declared. Variables declared inside a rule are local to that rule block. Nesting and order matter. If you shadow a variable inside a nested block then that inner value wins for the scope of the block. Declare your global tokens in one file and import them early so surprises do not happen.</p>

  <h2>Compile, test, and inspect the output</h2>
  <p>After edits run your preprocessor to generate CSS and then inspect the compiled stylesheet. A quick sanity check is to look for the expected values in the output. If you have a build step run it locally with the same flags your CI uses so you do not discover differences during review time.</p>
  <p>Typical workflow examples for frontend teams might use a command line like</p>
  <pre><code>sass source.scss output.css</code></pre>

  <h2>Best practices and tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep global tokens in a single file for discovery and consistency</li>
    <li>Prefix component variables to avoid accidental overrides</li>
    <li>Use descriptive names for colors spacing and typography</li>
    <li>Document which variables are public API for a component and which are internal details</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Wrap up time. Sass variables are not glamorous but they are effective. Use clear names adopt predictable scope rules and run your preprocessor as part of both local testing and CI. Your future teammates will thank you or at least send fewer angry messages at midnight.</p>
