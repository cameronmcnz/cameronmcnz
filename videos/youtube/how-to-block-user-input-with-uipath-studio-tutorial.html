<h2>Why block user input in RPA</h2>
<p>If you build automation in UiPath Studio you have probably seen a human test the bot and then click the wrong thing at the worst possible moment. Blocking user input is a pragmatic defense. It prevents accidental clicks and stray keystrokes from corrupting a run and keeps your automation predictable. This tutorial covers Block User Input so your robots do their job without being interrupted by panic clicking.</p>

<h3>Quick note on vocabulary</h3>
<p>When I say Block User Input I mean the UiPath activity from the System activities pack that can do mouse blocking and keyboard blocking during a critical section of a workflow. This is a best practice for sensitive steps but not a license to freeze users forever.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UiPath Studio with the System activities pack installed</li>
  <li>Access to a test VM or a non production PC for experiments</li>
  <li>Basic familiarity with sequences, try catch and scopes in UiPath</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step by step guide</h2>
<p>Follow these sensible steps and your automation will be less likely to be derailed by human curiosity.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Add the Block User Input activity to your workflow</strong>
    <p>Put it inside the sequence or flow that contains the critical UI or keyboard work. Use the activity bundled with System activities so the block lasts only while the activity is active.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Configure properties</strong>
    <p>Set BlockMouse = True or BlockKeyboard = True depending on what you need to protect. If you want both set both to True. Use TimeoutMS to provide a safety fallback duration or keep the block inside an explicit scope so it ends naturally when the scoped actions finish. Keep blocks as short as possible because users do not enjoy frozen mice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wrap the block in error handling</strong>
    <p>Use Try Catch or a Finally like construct so the release is guaranteed. In the Catch call an unblock or ensure the workflow reaches the activity that releases the block. This avoids that hair raising moment when the screen appears locked and someone yanks the machine offline to save the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Test on a safe machine</strong>
    <p>Run the workflow on a virtual machine or test PC. Validate both keyboard blocking and mouse blocking scenarios and exercise recovery paths. Logging the start and end times of the block helps you prove the block behaved as expected and aids debugging when things go sideways.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Error handling and recovery</h2>
<p>Error handling is where many implementations fail less gloriously. Always plan for exceptions. Use a Try Catch that catches generic exceptions and logs them. In the Finally or in the Catch block make sure the workflow calls the unblock logic or naturally exits the Block User Input activity scope. That prevents lingering blocks that force manual intervention.</p>

<h3>Practical tips for reliability</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prefer short focused blocks that cover only the critical actions</li>
  <li>Combine Block User Input with robust logging so you can trace duration and reason</li>
  <li>Never assume a block will never fail use timeouts and recovery paths</li>
  <li>Test edge cases like abrupt exceptions and system sleep or screen lock events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example configuration snippet</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;Block User Input BlockMouse = True BlockKeyboard = True TimeoutMS = 300000&gt;
  &lt;Perform UI actions here&gt;
&lt;/Block User Input&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This pseudo snippet shows the idea. Use the properties in Studio exactly as labeled. TimeoutMS is useful as a last resort safety net but do not rely on it instead of proper error handling.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts and best practices</h2>
<p>Block User Input is a simple feature that gives big returns in stability for desktop automations. Use it sparingly and with good error handling. Test on a VM and log everything. Your users will thank you silently and your support queue will be marginally less dramatic.</p>
