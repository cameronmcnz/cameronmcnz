<p>Welcome to the cloud adventure where you get free compute, storage, and the occasional billing surprise if you are not paying attention. This guide walks you through creating an Amazon Web Services account, activating the AWS Free Tier, and locking down basic security so you can tinker without crying over your credit card bill.</p>

<h2>What you need before you start</h2>
<p>Don t rush in like a heroic script kiddie. Gather a few things first</p>
<ul>
  <li>A dedicated email for cloud accounts so your inbox does not become a graveyard</li>
  <li>A valid credit or debit card for identity verification and any non free tier charges</li>
  <li>A phone that can receive SMS or calls for the verification step</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick signup walkthrough</h2>
<p>Here are the practical steps to get an AWS account and Free Tier access. Follow them and you will have a functioning AWS account that does not immediately roast your wallet.</p>

<h3>Step 1 Visit the AWS homepage</h3>
<p>Click the Create an AWS Account button. Use the dedicated email from earlier so you can separate cloud invoices from family spam and newsletters.</p>

<h3>Step 2 Enter contact and payment details</h3>
<p>Fill in your contact info and add a credit or debit card. This is mainly for identity checks and to cover any usage beyond the Free Tier. AWS does not charge you for verifying the card in most cases but keep an eye on any temporary holds.</p>

<h3>Step 3 Verify your phone</h3>
<p>Provide a phone number and complete the SMS or automated call verification. Yes it is annoying, but it blocks a lot of fraud and keeps your account from being a playground for bots.</p>

<h3>Step 4 Choose the Basic support plan</h3>
<p>Select the Basic support plan, which is free. Paid plans exist if you want ticket priority and more hand holding, but Basic is perfect for learning and small projects.</p>

<h3>Step 5 Confirm Free Tier eligibility</h3>
<p>Review what the AWS Free Tier includes and its monthly limits. Common examples are EC2 compute hours, S3 storage, and certain RDS database hours. Heavy workloads can blow past these limits fast, so be conservative when testing.</p>

<h2>Lock down security and access</h2>
<p>Do not use the root account for daily work. Root is basically the master key to the kingdom and you should treat it with fear and respect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an IAM user for yourself with administrative privileges or use granular roles if you prefer fewer disasters</li>
  <li>Enable multifactor authentication on the root account right away and on any IAM accounts that can alter billing or create resources</li>
  <li>Follow the principle of least privilege when you assign permissions to IAM users and roles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keep your wallet safe</h2>
<p>Billing alerts are your friends. Configure alerts in the Billing console and set up an AWS Budgets threshold to trigger email notifications. That way you learn about unexpected charges before the bank calls you.</p>

<h3>Practical tips to avoid accidental charges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tag resources you create so you can find and delete them later</li>
  <li>Use small instance types and free tier eligible services while learning</li>
  <li>Shut down or terminate test resources when you are done instead of leaving them running</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final checklist for the beginner</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Account created with a dedicated email</li>
  <li>Payment method added and phone verified</li>
  <li>Basic support plan selected</li>
  <li>Free Tier reviewed for EC2, S3, and RDS limits</li>
  <li>IAM user created and MFA enabled on root and admin accounts</li>
  <li>Billing alerts and AWS Budgets configured</li>
</ul>

<p>If you follow this checklist you will be ready to explore Amazon Web Services without accidentally funding a small server farm. Now go make something dumb but educational, and remember to clean up when you are done.</p>
