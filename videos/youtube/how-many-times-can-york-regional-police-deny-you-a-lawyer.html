<p>Yes this clip exists and yes the officer said no multiple times while the person kept asking for a lawyer. If that makes you want to scream into a pillow you are not alone. This is about access to lawyer rights and how repeated police denial can mess with the rest of a case.</p>

<h2>Quick legal reality check</h2>
<p>Under the Canadian Charter section 10(b) everyone who is detained must be told they have the right to retain and instruct counsel and must be given a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. The Supreme Court in R v Brydges requires police to offer duty counsel when a private lawyer is not reachable. Repeated refusals to allow contact can be treated by courts as a breach of that right and can affect whether any statements are admitted in court.</p>

<h2>What to say and do when police deny your lawyer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Say the words I want a lawyer and then shut up. Clear direct words help later in court.</li>
  <li>If no private lawyer is on the line ask for duty counsel right away. Duty counsel is what the courts expect police to offer under R v Brydges.</li>
  <li>Note times names exact wording and who denied you access. If you can get a bystander to timestamp that is even better.</li>
  <li>Ask to speak to a supervising officer if denials keep happening. Record the request if possible.</li>
  <li>Tell your lawyer about every denial and ask about a Charter remedy. That is the tool defence counsel uses if your right was violated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How courts decide if your right was respected</h3>
<p>Courts look at whether police gave a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel not whether an officer was polite. A brief safety or investigative pause may be allowed but multiple refusals raise the question of whether any real reason existed. Clear requests and good documentation make it much easier for a defence lawyer to challenge police denial or police misconduct.</p>

<h2>Practical tips for surviving the interaction</h2>
<p>Keep a mental log or ask someone to note timestamps and what was said. If a phone is available insist on calling duty counsel and repeat I want to speak to a lawyer every time you are blocked. If you are recording in a jurisdiction where that is legal then record. If not try to get names badge numbers and the time of refusals written down.</p>

<h3>Key takeaway</h3>
<p>Police must allow access to counsel unless there is a narrow safety or investigative window that justifies a short delay. Multiple refusals look bad for the prosecution and can lead to a Charter remedy that excludes evidence. In short document everything demand duty counsel and tell your lawyer about every denial because those small details are how a Judge will figure out if your Charter rights were real or just words on a poster.</p>
