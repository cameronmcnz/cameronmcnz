<h2>Quick summary for people who like numbers and drama</h2>
<p>Yes people are calling Frederik Andersen the worst NHL goalie right now. Yes that headline sells. Here is what the numbers actually show and why a few ugly games do not equal a career verdict. I will cover save percentage and GAA alongside rebound control positioning and puck handling so you can decide if this is a slump or a meltdown.</p>

<h3>What the basic stats are telling us</h3>
<p>Save percentage and goals against average give you a fast read on a goalie performance. Early season numbers can swing hard though. Small sample size plus a few high danger goals allowed will make those metrics look dramatic. Expected goals and high danger save percentage help separate bad puck luck from real technical decline.</p>

<h3>Key checks before you declare someone the worst</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Save percentage and GAA over a meaningful sample</li>
  <li>High danger save percentage and expected goals against</li>
  <li>Video evidence of positioning or rebound problems</li>
  <li>Team defensive quality and shot volume in front of the net</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where Andersen has actually struggled</h2>
<p>The recurring complaints are familiar and legitimate. Rebound control is one of them. Loose saves that turn into secondary chances are what turn routine stops into immediate threats. When rebounds are given away opponents feel like they are getting a bonus point.</p>

<p>Positioning also shows up on replays. Small errors in depth and angle management lead to more wraparounds and cross crease chances than you would expect. Those are teachable mistakes but they cost the team in high danger situations.</p>

<p>Puck handling has produced a handful of avoidable turnovers. When a goalie makes a bad play behind the net it becomes a highlight reel assist in the worst way. That tends to stick in fans memory because those plays are flashy and directly lead to odd man rushes.</p>

<h2>What the deeper metrics tell us</h2>
<p>Expected goals and high danger save percentage are your friends here. If Andersen s expected goals against is far worse than the league average and his high danger save percentage is dropping that suggests real performance issues. If those numbers lag while the raw save percentage is dragged down by bad rebounds or defensive breakdowns then context matters more.</p>

<h3>How to watch for the right things</h3>
<p>Game footage beats hot takes. Watch how he handles traffic in tight areas watch how he uses his pads and glove to wall off rebounds and watch his reads on cross crease passes. If the problems are mostly rebound control and reads you can usually coach that back. If the problems are slower reaction time or lost depth in the crease you have a bigger project.</p>

<h2>Practical takeaways for Leafs fans and analysts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not hang a worst goalie label on a handful of games. Hockey seasons are long.</li>
  <li>Use expected goals and high danger save percentage alongside save percentage and GAA.</li>
  <li>Watch video to tell whether the issue is technique team defense or bad luck.</li>
  <li>Remember team shot quality matters a lot when evaluating a goalie.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frederik Andersen can be frustrating to watch when things go sideways but context often softens the headline. If you want to scream into the void do it with some advanced metrics in hand and a highlight clip queued up. That way you get both catharsis and accuracy.
