<p>Merge gone sideways again? Relax a little and do not panic. Git merge conflicts are annoying but reversible if you follow steps that do not involve stabbing your keyboard. This guide shows how to inspect a stuck merge, run the safe abort, and fall back to stronger resets while keeping your local edits intact.</p>

<h2>Check the merge state</h2>
<p>First things first check where Git is at with a quick status run. The command below shows unmerged paths and conflict markers and points out the branch you tried to merge into.</p>
<pre><code>git status</code></pre>
<p>Look for files listed as unmerged. That output tells you whether to resolve, stash, or abort. If you are mid merge and nothing important is staged yet aborting is often the right choice.</p>

<h2>Try the safe abort</h2>
<p>If the merge was started in this session and you want to return to the last committed snapshot run the safe abort command. It attempts a clean rollback of index and working tree to the pre merge state.</p>
<pre><code>git merge --abort</code></pre>
<p>This is the least dramatic option. It preserves committed work and undoes the attempted merge. If it works you are back to normal with minimal trauma.</p>

<h2>Fallback resets when abort fails</h2>
<p>Sometimes the abort command bails out. For a more forceful cleanup try the reset mode that handles merge conflicts more aggressively.</p>
<pre><code>git reset --merge</code></pre>
<p>If you truly want to wipe uncommitted changes and start fresh use the nuclear option.</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD</code></pre>
<p>Warning do not use the hard reset if you have local edits you care about. That command discards uncommitted changes without mercy.</p>

<h2>Protect or recover local work</h2>
<p>If you have edits you want to keep stash them before destructive actions. Stashing is a quick safety net.</p>
<pre><code>git stash push -m "save before abort"
</code></pre>
<p>If you accidentally destroy something check the reflog which records recent HEAD movements and can help recover lost commits.</p>
<pre><code>git reflog
git checkout -b rescue <commit-hash-from-reflog>
</code></pre>

<h3>Quick checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run git status to inspect unmerged files</li>
<li>Try git merge --abort for the clean rollback</li>
<li>Use git reset --merge if abort does not work</li>
<li>Use git reset --hard HEAD only when you accept data loss</li>
<li>Stash local edits with git stash before risky moves</li>
<li>Use git reflog to find and recover lost commits</li>
</ul>

<p>Final tip make small commits and stash often. That habit turns panic into a minor inconvenience and keeps your repo from becoming a drama series.</p>
