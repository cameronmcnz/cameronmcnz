<h2>When wildlife decides your windshield is a trampoline</h2>
<p>Yes this happened on Highway 401 and yes it was caught on dashcam. A raven collided with a moving windshield and the footage makes you wince and then feel very grateful for laminated glass. Bird strikes follow the same physics whether you are in a car or a plane. The impact energy is E = 1/2 m v^2 where m is bird mass and v is relative speed. A heavy raven at highway velocity can pack enough energy to crack laminated glass or create a sudden distraction that is far more dangerous than the hole in your pride.</p>

<h3>Immediate moves that do not involve crying in traffic</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stay calm and keep steering steady, do not make sudden lane changes. Panic makes pileups more likely than the bird ever could.</li>
  <li>Signal and pull over to a safe shoulder or rest area when traffic allows. Hazard lights help other drivers understand you are not pretending to be a parade float.</li>
  <li>Check for injuries first. Seatbelts and airbags are your first line of defense, so make sure everyone is okay before inspecting glass damage.</li>
  <li>Use your dashcam footage if you have it. It helps with insurance and also gives you proof that the bird was the aggressor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to inspect the damage without risking a second headline</h3>
<p>Stand away from traffic when you check the windshield. Look for cracks that affect structural integrity. Small star breaks near the edge or in the periphery are often repairable. Long cracks across the driver sightline usually mean a full windshield replacement. Take wide shots and close ups of the damage plus surrounding context like lane markers or mile posts so your insurer does not ask if you were part of a demolition derby.</p>

<h3>Documenting and calling in the cavalry</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Photograph the whole windshield and the close up damage from different angles. Include dashcam clips when possible.</li>
  <li>Call a glass repair service or your insurer as needed. Many chips can be repaired quickly, but replaced windshields can take time and a tow if the crack is severe.</li>
  <li>If carcass removal is needed use gloves or a shovel and double bag the remains. Carcasses can be biohazards and you do not want to be the person who learned that the hard way.</li>
  <li>Report unusual wildlife mortality to local wildlife authorities so they can track patterns and prevent repeat attacks at the same spot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why laminated windshields help and what still matters</h3>
<p>Modern laminated glass is designed to absorb energy and stay largely intact rather than sending you shards of glass with your morning commute. Still the glass is only part of vehicle safety. Seatbelts, airbags, and safe driving behavior remain the primary protection against injury. Keep your speed reasonable in areas with lots of wildlife and scan the road edges for movement, especially at dawn and dusk.</p>

<h3>Quick checklist for after a bird strike</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check everyone for injury</li>
  <li>Pull over safely and use hazard lights</li>
  <li>Document damage with photos and dashcam clips</li>
  <li>Contact glass repair or insurer</li>
  <li>Dispose of carcass safely and notify wildlife authorities if needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Bird strikes are dramatic and inconvenient, but handled properly they are rarely catastrophic. Stay steady, document everything, and let the professionals handle the glass and the paperwork. Oh and maybe download that dashcam clip so you can show friends how a raven tried to commit vehicular sabotage on the 401.</p>
