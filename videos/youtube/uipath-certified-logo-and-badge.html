<h1>How to use UiPath badges and logos without breaking the rules</h1>
<p>If you passed a UiPath exam congrats you now own a shiny Certification Badge and maybe permission to use a UiPath logo. These are not just pretty icons to slap on everything. The Certification Badge is your personal digital credential and it usually carries metadata and a verification link. The UiPath logo is a brand mark for organizations and partners. Use both correctly and they help with recruiter discovery and vendor assessments. Abuse them and you will get politely asked to remove them or worse receive a stern brand guideline email.</p>

<h2>Quick verification and sharing rules</h2>
<p>Keep your Credential Verification link handy. Recruiters and hiring managers will click it and prefer that over guessing which version of your resume is accurate. When you share a Digital Badge on LinkedIn or in an email signature include the verification link and a one line context sentence about the exam focus. That saves time and avoids the awkward quiz about what you actually tested on.</p>

<h2>Logo usage and brand guidelines everyone should follow</h2>
<p>UiPath brand rules exist for a reason. Size, clear space, placement and color consistency protect the mark and prevent your resume from looking like a ransom note. If you are using a UiPath logo for partner or company materials get express permission and follow the official assets and Brand Guidelines. For companies this helps preserve partner status and prevents embarrassing takedown requests.</p>

<h3>Practical checklist for logo and badge use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always link the badge to its verification URL when possible</li>
  <li>Do not alter logo colors or crop the badge art</li>
  <li>Keep clear space and readable size for logos on documents</li>
  <li>Use official assets that match UiPath guidance for partner materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common missteps that make brand teams sigh</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Placing a badge next to unrelated logos so people assume false partnerships</li>
  <li>Changing badge colors for design flair which breaks metadata checks</li>
  <li>Uploading low resolution logos that look pixelated in proposals</li>
  <li>Using an organization logo without permission for a personal profile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to display the badge when you want to seem employable</h2>
<p>Best places to show a UiPath Certification Badge are LinkedIn, your personal website, portfolio pages and email signatures. For RPA focused résumés include a short line about the exam topic so hiring managers know whether you automated invoices or turned coffee into code. This helps with Career Development and makes your Professional Certification meaningful to recruiters.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for teams and careers</h2>
<p>Proper logo usage and badge sharing benefits everyone. It signals verified skill, speeds up vendor assessments and keeps brand trust intact. For individuals a clean badge presentation improves recruiter discovery and lends credibility during interviews. For organizations consistent Logo Usage preserves partner status and protects the value of UiPath Certification for all certified professionals.</p>

<h2>Final tip</h2>
<p>When you post your Digital Badge always include the verification link and one clear sentence about what the certification covered. That little bit of context saves time and spares you from explaining basic RPA concepts to strangers who pretend they did not click the link.</p>
