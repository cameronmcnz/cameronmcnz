<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of cloud computing where free sometimes means free and sometimes means an invoice that makes you rethink life choices. This beginner friendly AWS Free Tier tutorial walks you through creating an AWS account fast while avoiding the classic billing traps and basic security mistakes.</p>

<h2>What to gather before you start</h2>
<p>Spoiler alert, Amazon wants to know who you are and how to charge you if things go sideways. Get these ready so the signup does not turn into a scavenger hunt.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Email</strong> Use a dedicated business or personal email that can receive verification messages and password recovery mail.</li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong> Keep your mobile nearby for SMS or voice verification steps during signup and for MFA setup later.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment method</strong> A valid credit or debit card is required for a small temporary authorization charge that usually gets refunded by the bank.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create the AWS account</h2>
<p>Go to the official AWS signup page and follow the prompts. Provide accurate contact details and choose the account type that matches your plans. Activation can take a few minutes or a few hours depending on identity checks, so do not panic if you do not see access immediately.</p>
<p>During verification you will accept a small temporary charge used for card authorization. That charge is not a regular bill and most banks refund it automatically. If the verification step stalls respond to any phone or email prompts right away to avoid delays.</p>

<h2>Lock down root access and create an admin user</h2>
<p>The root user is the account equivalent of a nuclear launch code. Do not use it for daily work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable multi factor authentication MFA on the root account before you launch any resources.</li>
  <li>Create an admin IAM user and give that user administrative permissions for day to day tasks.</li>
  <li>Store your recovery information in a safe place and use a password manager for tough unique passwords.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set budgets and billing alerts to avoid nasty surprises</h2>
<p>Free tier is generous but not infinite. Enable billing controls early so you get an email before your cloud bill becomes a horror story.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure an AWS budget and set email alerts at thresholds you are comfortable with.</li>
  <li>Turn on cost explorer and detailed billing to see which services are creeping above free tier limits.</li>
  <li>Create CloudWatch billing alarms to catch unexpected spend spikes fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Launch free tier eligible resources and monitor usage</h2>
<p>Use the Free Tier eligible services to learn cloud basics without breaking the bank. Start small and keep an eye on consumption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>EC2 use t2 or t3 micro instances under the free tier and monitor hours running.</li>
  <li>S3 has a free storage allowance so check data egress to avoid extra charges.</li>
  <li>RDS has a limited free tier for certain engines and sizes so follow usage closely.</li>
  <li>Serverless options like Lambda often stay cheap for light workloads and are nice for beginners trying out cloud computing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practical monitoring tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tag resources with environment or owner so you know who is generating cost.</li>
  <li>Review the cost explorer weekly while you are learning to spot unusual trends early.</li>
  <li>Turn off or terminate resources when you are done testing to avoid surprise charges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick checklist before you click launch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email phone and payment method ready</li>
  <li>Complete identity verification and card authorization</li>
  <li>MFA enabled on root and an admin IAM user created</li>
  <li>Budgets, billing alerts and cost explorer enabled</li>
  <li>Monitor free tier limits for EC2 S3 RDS and other services</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will have a secure AWS account ready for cloud experiments without turning your free tier into a surprise bill. If something does go wrong breathing helps and so does checking billing reports and support options promptly.</p>
