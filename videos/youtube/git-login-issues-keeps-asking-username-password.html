<p>Ever opened your terminal and felt like Git is personally offended whenever you try to push? If Git keeps asking for your username and password like a needy ex this guide will show you how to make it go away. We cover how to check what kind of remote you have, pick a credential helper, use a personal access token for HTTPS providers, and switch to SSH keys when you want peace and quiet.</p>

<h2>Quick diagnosis</h2>
<p>Before we start throwing configuration at the problem, find out what kind of remote you are actually talking to. HTTPS remotes will ask for credentials unless you store them. SSH remotes should not ask for a password once a valid key is installed.</p>
<pre><code>git remote -v
git remote show origin</code></pre>
<p>If you see an address that looks like an HTTPS style address then that is why you get prompts. If it is an SSH style address then something is wrong with your key setup.</p>

<h2>Set a credential helper that matches your operating system</h2>
<p>Credential helpers securely store or cache your credentials so you do not have to type them on every push and pull. Pick the one that matches your platform.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows</strong> use the Git Credential Manager</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper manager-core</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><strong>macOS</strong> use the Keychain helper</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Linux</strong> you can persist credentials in a file or use a short term cache</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper store
# or
git config --global credential.helper cache</code></pre>
<p>store writes credentials to ~/.git-credentials in plain text. Use it only if you understand the risks or the machine is yours and locked down.</p>

<h2>Use a personal access token for HTTPS providers</h2>
<p>Many code hosts now require a personal access token rather than your account password when using HTTPS authentication. When a password is requested paste the token instead of your account password. Create the token in your hosting account settings and give it the minimal scopes needed for your workflow. For example a private repo may need repo scope but do not give it more power than necessary.</p>

<h2>Switch to SSH keys for fewer prompts</h2>
<p>If you want fewer prompts and less friction then SSH keys are the reliable option. The steps are boring and effective.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate a key pair on your machine</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Start the agent and add the key</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Copy the public key and paste it into your hosting account SSH keys page</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code></pre>
<p>Once the public key is added to your account switch the remote to the SSH style URL provided by the host. Replace SSH_URL with the address shown by your provider.</p>
<pre><code>git remote set-url origin SSH_URL</code></pre>

<h3>Troubleshooting when prompts persist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remote still shows HTTPS after you expected SSH. Verify with git remote -v and update the URL with git remote set-url origin SSH_URL.</li>
  <li>Wrong credential helper in use. Check with git config --global credential.helper and change it to the platform helper you need.</li>
  <li>Stale or bad stored credentials. Remove them from the OS credential store, delete ~/.git-credentials if you used store, or clear the cached entries.</li>
  <li>Multiple accounts on the same host can confuse helpers. Use separate SSH keys or separate credential helpers per repository if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary and final tips</h2>
<p>Check the remote to know if it is HTTPS or SSH. Set a credential helper that matches your operating system. Use a personal access token when the host requires one and paste it into the password prompt. If you want the least friction switch to SSH keys and update the remote URL. Do not use store unless you accept the security tradeoffs. Now go push your code and enjoy the silence.</p>
