<h2>Overview and why WSDL first matters</h2>
<p>If you like contracts that everyone can read and nobody can ignore, WSDL first is your friend. This guide walks through creating a top down SOAP web service in Eclipse using a WSDL first approach and JAX WS code generation. You will end up with a predictable service, fewer surprises at runtime, and just enough bureaucracy to make clients behave.</p>

<h2>Step 1 Prepare the WSDL</h2>
<p>Start by drafting a clear WSDL that defines the service name, operations, message parts, port types, bindings and target namespace. Think of the WSDL as the marriage certificate between server and client. If you make it messy, both sides will regret it later.</p>
<p>Keep the WSDL focused on the contract. Use meaningful element names and work out your complex types with JAXB mapping in mind. Stable namespaces and versioning make life easier for anyone stuck maintaining this in year three.</p>

<h2>Step 2 Create the Eclipse project</h2>
<p>Create a Dynamic Web Project or a Maven web project in Eclipse, whichever fits your build habits. If you use Maven, add the JAX WS dependencies to your pom to avoid dropping jars on the build path like it is 2005.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic Web Project for GUI loving developers</li>
  <li>Maven web project for reproducible builds and dependency sanity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3 Generate server side code from WSDL</h2>
<p>Use wsimport or the Eclipse Web Services tools to generate the server artifacts. These tools will create the service endpoint interface, the service class and JAXB data classes for your XML types. Generated code saves keystrokes and enforces a consistent contract mapping between XML and Java.</p>

<h2>Step 4 Implement the endpoint</h2>
<p>Open the generated skeleton classes and implement your endpoint methods. Add business logic, validate inputs, map domain models to JAXB types, and resist the urge to cram every utility method into the service class. Keep the endpoint focused so testing stays sane.</p>

<h2>Step 5 Configure and deploy to a servlet container</h2>
<p>Deploy to Tomcat or any servlet container that supports JAX WS. Make sure your web xml or programmatic endpoint configuration matches the WSDL service name and namespace. Mismatched namespaces are the top cause of mysterious failures and bad developer moods.</p>
<p>Watch classpath and dependency versions closely. Version conflicts show up at runtime with delightful stacktraces that never describe the root cause.</p>

<h2>Step 6 Test with a SOAP client</h2>
<p>Test the deployed service using SOAP UI, curl, or a small Java client. Hit the WSDL URL, exercise each operation with sample SOAP envelopes, and confirm headers, fault handling and data type mapping behave as expected. Pay attention to SOAP headers that carry authentication or metadata, and make sure faults return useful information without leaking secrets.</p>

<h3>Quick test checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Can clients fetch the WSDL URL</li>
  <li>Each operation accepts and returns expected types</li>
  <li>Faults use intended SOAP fault structure</li>
  <li>Namespaces match between WSDL and runtime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recap and tips</h2>
<p>The workflow is straightforward. Design the WSDL first, generate server code, implement endpoints, deploy, and test. This produces a predictable SOAP service that clients can consume without relying on blind luck.</p>
<p>Keep the WSDL stable and adopt namespace versioning for breaking changes. Use Maven to manage JAX WS dependencies and avoid manual jar juggling. And finally, document the contract well so future developers do not resort to guesswork or ritual sacrifice to make clients work.</p>
