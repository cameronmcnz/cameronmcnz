  <h2>High level difference between developer and DevOps engineer</h2>
  <p>Pick a side if you must but know this up front. Developers build the features users actually care about, the shiny parts that get clicks and applause. DevOps engineers make sure those shiny parts arrive without waking up the whole team at 3 a.m. One cares about product and user experience, the other cares about automation, reliability and not being paged on weekends.</p>

  <h3>Day to day realities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developer</strong> Write code, review pull requests, debug business logic, and obsess over tests and UX. Typical tools include Node, Spring, testing frameworks, and source control. Success is measured by feature velocity, code quality and user metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>DevOps engineer</strong> Design CI CD pipelines, manage infrastructure as code with Terraform, orchestrate containers with Kubernetes, and tune monitoring and observability. Typical telemetry is deployment frequency, mean time to recovery and uptime.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common tools and where they sit</h3>
  <p>If you like terminals and config files you will find Terraform, Kubernetes and cloud APIs comforting. If you like writing business logic you will cozy up to web frameworks and unit tests. CI CD platforms are the glue that makes both sides slightly less dramatic.</p>

  <h2>Why roles overlap and why that is good</h2>
  <p>Teams do not live in separate bubbles. A developer who automates deployments ships faster. A DevOps engineer who can read application code troubleshoots faster. Cross training increases interview luck and reduces all nighters. Also it gives you more career options when your boss finally retires their faith in duct tape.</p>

  <h3>Concrete examples that are not corporate bingo</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Git and your favorite web framework for the application layer.</li>
    <li>Use Terraform for provisioning and Kubernetes for runtime orchestration.</li>
    <li>Use a CI CD platform to build tests, run deployments and trigger rollbacks if things go sideways.</li>
    <li>Add observability with logs, metrics and traces so incidents become stories not mysteries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to choose your path</h2>
  <p>Choose developer work if you want to solve product driven problems, design features and wrestle with algorithms. Choose DevOps if you like orchestration, automation and systems at scale. Both reward curiosity, good debugging habits and the capacity to tolerate bad coffee.</p>

  <h3>Starter project that teaches both</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Build a tiny web app that shows something useful.</li>
    <li>Write infrastructure as code to provision a small cloud environment with Terraform.</li>
    <li>Wire a CI CD pipeline to run tests and deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.</li>
    <li>Add basic observability so you get alerts and can practice incident drills without actually panicking.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Do that and you will learn feature design and delivery faster than any job title will teach you. Plus you will sleep more, which is underrated.</p>
