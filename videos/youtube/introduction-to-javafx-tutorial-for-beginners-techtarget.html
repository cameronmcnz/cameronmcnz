<p>If you want to build a desktop GUI with Java and you are tired of guessing what goes where welcome to the slightly less mysterious world of JavaFX. This guide walks you through project setup scene graph basics common controls event handling FXML and how to actually ship your app without blaming the user for missing Java versions.</p>

<h2>Project setup and runtime choices</h2>
<p>Start by creating a Java project in your IDE or on the command line. You can add the JavaFX SDK jars directly or declare dependencies with Maven or Gradle. If your project uses the module system configure the module path so the JVM can find javafx modules. If you are not using modules put JavaFX on the classpath and run with the appropriate VM flags.</p>

<h3>Dependency options</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Manual SDK Add the JavaFX SDK jars to your project and keep an eye on the runtime path</li>
  <li>Maven or Gradle Declare the org openjfx artifacts and let the build tool fetch the right versions</li>
  <li>Modules or classpath Decide based on your app size and deployment strategy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimal app structure</h2>
<p>Create a main class that extends Application and override the start method which receives a Stage argument. Build a Scene from a root node then call primaryStage setScene and primaryStage show to display the window. No magical incantations required just a tiny amount of elbow grease.</p>

<h3>Scene graph and layouts</h3>
<p>Think of the scene graph as a family tree for UI elements. Pick a layout suited for your screen arrangement BorderPane for sash style apps VBox for stacked content GridPane for form like layouts. Add controls like Button Label TextField and ListView to the scene graph and style them with CSS when you want them to look less like a school project.</p>

<h2>Controls and event handling</h2>
<p>Attach event handlers with lambda expressions for concise code or create handler classes when your app gets serious. Property bindings are your friend for keeping UI elements in sync with model data without writing glue code constantly.</p>

<h3>Typical patterns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Button setOnAction using a lambda to respond to clicks</li>
  <li>Use bindings to connect a label to an observable property so updates happen automatically</li>
  <li>Run background work with Task and update the UI safely with Platform runLater when needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>FXML and separation of concerns</h2>
<p>FXML lets you split interface markup from application logic so designers can tweak the layout while developers focus on behavior. Use a controller class to wire FXML injected nodes to your code. This keeps your code cleaner and your future self less likely to cry when adding new features.</p>

<h2>Testing building and distribution</h2>
<p>Run the app from your IDE or with the java command using the correct module or classpath flags. For distribution produce a runtime image with jlink or create a native installer with jpackage so end users do not need to wrestle with Java versions. Automated tests and small sample UIs like a form or a todo list help verify your event handling bindings and layout choices.</p>

<h2>Quick checklist for a usable JavaFX app</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project configured with JavaFX dependencies</li>
  <li>Main class extends Application and start shows the primary stage</li>
  <li>Scene graph rooted at a layout node</li>
  <li>Controls wired with event handlers and bindings</li>
  <li>Background tasks run with Task and UI updates use Platform runLater</li>
  <li>Optional FXML for markup and CSS for styling</li>
  <li>Packaging plan using jlink or jpackage for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps build a small form or a todo app and you will have a solid foundation in JavaFX fundamentals. If something breaks remember that error messages exist to remind you where you went wrong and that the fix is usually to check module paths dependencies and obvious typos.</p>
