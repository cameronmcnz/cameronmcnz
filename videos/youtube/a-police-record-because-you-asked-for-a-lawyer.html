<p>Yes this happened. A person asked for a lawyer and a York Police officer recorded the encounter, handwritten notes appeared and Constable Orshansky was named in the paperwork. If that sounds like your plot twist then you need a plan that is clearer than the officer badge number scribble you will be handed later.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for your right to counsel</h2>
<p>Asking for a lawyer is not a magic trick that makes all questions disappear but it is a serious legal request. A clear request for counsel should pause voluntary questioning and preserve basic citizen rights. If a police record is created after you ask for counsel do not assume your rights evaporated because someone wrote something down.</p>

<h3>Keep your cool and say this</h3>
<p>Calm things down. State your name if asked and provide basic identification if you must. Then say that you request a lawyer and that you will not answer other questions until you speak to counsel. Short and simple wins here. Avoid arguing about the law on the sidewalk. That is what lawyers and complaint forms are for.</p>

<h2>Practical steps to control the narrative</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Request counsel in plain language and repeat once if needed. Make your request audible and brief.</li>
  <li>Record the interaction on your phone when it is lawful and safe to do so. A timestamped clip beats shaky memory and hearsay.</li>
  <li>Ask the officer for their name and badge number and write it down. If Constable Orshansky is involved note that exact spelling and rank.</li>
  <li>Refuse voluntary questioning beyond name and basic ID. You do not have to chat about where you were or what you were doing.</li>
  <li>Ask where you can obtain a copy of any police record and who to contact about errors. Getting a copy early helps avoid messy surprises later.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to do if a police record appears</h3>
<p>Do not panic. Silence after the record is created does not necessarily mean you lost your rights. Collect documentary proof. If you recorded the stop upload a backup somewhere outside your phone. Gather witness names and short notes about what happened while it is fresh.</p>

<h2>Using official channels without drama</h2>
<p>If the content of the record seems off you can file a complaint through the York Police complaint process. That starts an administrative review and can prompt police accountability measures. Legal aid clinics and community legal clinics are useful if you want legal advice about disclosure requests or how to challenge the record in court.</p>

<h3>When to ask for help</h3>
<p>If you feel your civil rights or citizen rights were breached seek legal advice. Public interest groups and legal clinics can explain freedom of information requests where disclosure rules apply. If your case moves beyond paperwork then an experienced lawyer will help you navigate evidence and remedies.</p>

<h2>Quick checklist to keep in your pocket</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Say you want a lawyer and stop answering other questions</li>
  <li>Record the interaction when allowed and safe</li>
  <li>Get officer name badge and note details like time and location</li>
  <li>Ask how to get a copy of any police record</li>
  <li>File a complaint if there are discrepancies and get legal advice</li>
</ul>

<p>Final note do not trade calm for cleverness. A clear paper trail is more useful than a loud argument. If Constable Orshansky or York Police show up in a record that looks wrong the best response is documentation and the right set of next steps. You will thank yourself later when paperwork beats hearsay.</p>
