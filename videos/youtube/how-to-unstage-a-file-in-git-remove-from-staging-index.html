<p>So you accidentally staged a file and now you are plotting a quiet comeback where the wrong changes do not end up in the commit. Relax, Git is not judging you. It just has helpful commands to put things back where they belong without losing your work.</p>

<h2>Check your staging area with git status</h2>
<p>First, do some reconnaissance. The git status command shows what is staged and what is not. It tells you if a file is in the staging index or still haunting the working tree.</p>
<pre><code>git status</code></pre>

<h2>Unstage a single file with git restore</h2>
<p>Modern Git gives you git restore to pry things out of the staging index while leaving your working copy alone. That means the changes stay in your files so you can edit more or re stage specific hunks.</p>
<pre><code>git restore --staged path/to/file</code></pre>
<p>After this the file will show under changes not staged for commit or as untracked if it had never been committed before. Your edits are safe and not sent into the void.</p>

<h3>Legacy option for older Git installations</h3>
<p>If you are stuck on an older Git version use the old school command. It behaves similarly for the index and still keeps your working tree intact.</p>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD path/to/file</code></pre>

<h2>Unstage everything when you overdid it</h2>
<p>If you staged too many files and want a clean slate without losing any edits use the bulk command. Warning this will clear the whole index so only use it if you really mean it.</p>
<pre><code>git restore --staged .</code></pre>

<h2>Verify that the staging index is sane</h2>
<p>Run git status again to confirm the target files were moved out of staging. You will see them under changes not staged for commit or listed as untracked depending on their prior state.</p>
<pre><code>git status</code></pre>

<h3>Quick tips to avoid drama</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use git add -p to stage hunks instead of whole files. Fewer surprises and less midnight debugging.</li>
  <li>If you want to move only part of a file out of staging consider resetting and then staging precise hunks with git add -p.</li>
  <li>Remember that unstaging does not erase your edits. It only edits the index and keeps your working tree intact.</li>
</ul>

<p>There you go. Unstage like a calm professional or a sleep deprived developer who still cares about a clean commit history. Either way your changes remain safe and your index is back under control.</p>
