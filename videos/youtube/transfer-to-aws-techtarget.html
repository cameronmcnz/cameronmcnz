<h2>Plan before you push to AWS</h2>
<p>Yes cloud migration can feel like herding cats while those cats run on invisible infrastructure. Do the boring work up front and you get fewer surprise invoices and fewer late night debugging tantrums. Start by inventorying apps dependencies and performance needs. Use discovery tools to collect metrics and note any compliance constraints. That data will drive your migration planning and stop your finance team from staging an intervention.</p>

<h2>Choose the right migration strategy</h2>
<p>Not every app needs to be rewritten. Pick the approach that fits the app and the business case. The usual suspects are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lift and shift</strong> for speed and minimal change</li>
  <li><strong>Replatform</strong> to get better long term value with small tweaks</li>
  <li><strong>Refactor</strong> when you need cloud native scale and can afford the work</li>
</ul>
<p>Map each application to one of these strategies and include rollback criteria a timeline and a communication plan so stakeholders stop asking for daily status texts.</p>

<h2>Prepare the cloud environment</h2>
<p>Set up accounts governance and security controls before moving anything. Configure identity and access management network segmentation and basic monitoring. Apply tagging and cost allocation policies from day one so billing reports make sense and nobody blames the migration for budget mysteries.</p>

<h3>Security and governance basics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use least privilege for IAM roles and enforce multi factor authentication</li>
  <li>Segment networks so one noisy app does not ruin the karaoke for the rest of the estate</li>
  <li>Enable logging and centralize alerts to detect misconfigurations quickly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execute the migration in stages</h2>
<p>Automation is your friend but staged rollouts are your sanity. Start with a proof of concept then a pilot cluster before broad migration. Run data replication tests and plan for downtime windows. Validate application behavior after traffic cutover. Expect at least one quirky dependency that demands creative problem solving and mild cursing.</p>

<h3>Execution checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Proof of concept for the migration pipeline</li>
  <li>Pilot migration of a low risk application</li>
  <li>Full scale replication and final cutover plan</li>
  <li>Rollback procedures and runbook for incidents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optimize and validate once workloads run</h2>
<p>Do not celebrate by buying expensive dashboards. Instead tune resource types and rightsizing autoscaling and storage tiers. Verify your security posture run penetration tests and set up continuous monitoring and alerting. Review cost after at least one billing cycle and apply savings plans reservations or architecture changes to remove waste.</p>

<h3>Cost optimization tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify underutilized instances and switch to smaller families</li>
  <li>Use autoscaling to avoid paying for idle capacity</li>
  <li>Consider savings plans or reservations for predictable workloads</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recap and a realistic tip</h2>
<p>Assess plan prepare execute and optimize. That sequence reduces risk improves visibility and helps teams avoid classic migration traps while keeping production systems stable. Start with a small low risk application and prove the pipeline. Early success builds momentum and gives you the moral authority to tell the skeptics to trust the plan.</p>

<p>Final bit of honesty If you want the perfect migration you will wait forever. Aim for a repeatable process that gets better with each wave and keep a sense of humor handy for the parts that do not go exactly as written.</p>
