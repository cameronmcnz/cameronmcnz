<h2>Quick plan to avoid accidental regrets</h2>
<p>Yes you can delete branches. No you should not do it while on the branch unless you enjoy confusing error messages. This guide walks through a safe, clean way to remove a local branch and its counterpart on the remote repository so your teammates stop asking what that weird feature branch was about.</p>

<h2>Step 1 Move off the branch you want to delete</h2>
<p>Switch to a stable branch before you try to remove the target. Deleting a branch you are currently on will either fail or make Git sulk loudly.</p>
<pre><code>git switch main
# or
git checkout main</code></pre>

<h2>Step 2 Delete the local branch the polite way or the rude way</h2>
<p>Pick your temperament. The polite delete refuses to remove a branch that still has unmerged work. The rude delete forces removal whether Git likes it or not.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safe delete which checks merge status</li>
  <pre><code>git branch -d branch-name</code></pre>
  <li>Force delete when you are absolutely sure history can go to the void</li>
  <pre><code>git branch -D branch-name</code></pre>
</ul>

<h3>Pro tip for the cautious</h3>
<p>If you want to double check that the branch is merged into your mainline run</p>
<pre><code>git branch --merged</code></pre>
<p>Only delete if your branch shows up in that list unless you have a very good reason.</p>

<h2>Step 3 Delete the branch on the remote so your repo stops lying to you</h2>
<p>Pushing a delete request removes the branch reference on the remote like origin or github. This is the part that stops the branch from showing up for other developers.</p>
<pre><code>git push origin --delete branch-name</code></pre>

<h2>Step 4 Verify and clean up stale references</h2>
<p>Fetch with pruning to remove stale remote references from your local clone. Then inspect all refs to confirm the branch is gone.</p>
<pre><code>git fetch --prune
git branch -a</code></pre>

<h3>When things still look like a mess</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If the remote still shows the branch check your remote web interface like GitHub to see if it was protected or blocked</li>
  <li>Use <code>git fetch --prune</code> again if local metadata is stale</li>
</ul>

<h2>A few best practices so you do not become the person who deletes main</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enable branch protection on important branches in your remote hosting service</li>
  <li>Create a short pre push checklist in your team workflow to prevent accidental deletes</li>
  <li>Use descriptive branch names so deleting the wrong one causes less drama</li>
  <li>Prefer safe deletes and only use force when you have confirmed the history can be discarded</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Move off the branch then delete locally with <code>git branch -d</code> or <code>-D</code> if you are forcing it. Push the delete with <code>git push origin --delete branch-name</code> and finish with <code>git fetch --prune</code> and <code>git branch -a</code> to verify. Be careful and set up protections so future you does not get blamed for chaos.</p>
