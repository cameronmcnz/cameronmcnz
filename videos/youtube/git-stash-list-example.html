<p>Welcome to the fine art of stash maintenance where you pretend you were working on a feature and not debugging the build for three hours. <code>git stash list</code> is your inventory command when half finished work needs to be parked and you need to look sane to your future self.</p>

<h2>Quick stash inventory</h2>
<p>Run <code>git stash list</code> to see what you have saved. The output gives a numbered stack that looks like a bulletin board for abandoned ideas. Example output might look like this</p>
<pre><code>stash@{0} - WIP on main 9b3f2c Fix layout glitch
stash@{1} - WIP on feature/auth work in progress
stash@{2} - WIP on experiment quick test</code></pre>
<p>Each entry is an index you can reference, like stash@{0} or stash@{1}. Naming stashes with a message makes life less cryptic and helps you avoid applying the wrong pile of code at the worst possible moment.</p>

<h2>Inspect a stash before you touch it</h2>
<p>If you do not want surprises run <code>git stash show -p stash@{0}</code> to view the full patch. That shows the exact hunks that were saved so you can decide if you want everything or only a part.</p>
<p>If you only need a quick summary use <code>git stash show stash@{0}</code> which gives a one line diffstat style summary. Use the full patch when you plan to cherry pick hunks or worry about conflicts.</p>

<h2>Apply or pop depending on how reckless you feel</h2>
<p>Use these commands based on how tidy you want your stash list to remain</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>git stash apply stash@{1}</code> reapplies changes and keeps the stash in the list for later</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> reapplies the top stash and removes it from the list in one move</li>
</ul>
<p>Pop is convenient and slightly reckless if your working tree or index has changes that can conflict. When in doubt apply into a temporary branch and inspect the result.</p>

<h2>Name and manage stashes for sanity</h2>
<p>Create a human readable stash message with a command like</p>
<pre><code>git stash push -m 'WIP feature X'</code></pre>
<p>Named stashes keep <code>git stash list</code> from reading like a crime scene log. When you finish with a stash remove it with</p>
<pre><code>git stash drop stash@{0}</code></pre>
<p>And if you want dramatic cleanup use</p>
<pre><code>git stash clear</code></pre>
<p>But remember clear deletes everything and there is no undo. This is not optional drama, this is permanent deletion of code you might need.</p>

<h3>Simple recovery workflow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the stash with <code>git stash show -p</code></li>
  <li>If unsure create a temp branch with <code>git checkout -b temp-restore</code></li>
  <li>Reapply the stash with <code>git stash apply stash@{0}</code> and test</li>
  <li>Once happy drop the stash with <code>git stash drop stash@{0}</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical tips that save time and dignity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use descriptive messages when you stash to speed up future brain recovery</li>
  <li>Prefer <code>git stash apply</code> if you want to keep a backup copy of the stash</li>
  <li>Use <code>git stash pop</code> when you are sure and you do not mind cleaning up right away</li>
  <li>When resolving conflicts on apply do it on a branch to avoid contaminating main work</li>
  <li>Keep your stash list tidy so it does not become a graveyard of abandoned experiments</li>
</ul>

<p>Stashing is not magic, it is a polite lie you tell your repo while you go fix something else. Use <code>git stash list</code> to keep track, inspect changes with <code>git stash show -p</code>, and restore carefully with <code>git stash apply</code> or <code>git stash pop</code>. Follow these steps and you will avoid the horror of restoring the wrong patch and wondering why the app broke in spectacular fashion.</p>
