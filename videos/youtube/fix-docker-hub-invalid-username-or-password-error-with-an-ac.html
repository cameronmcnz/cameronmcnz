<h2>Why access tokens fix Docker Hub login errors</h2>
<p>If you keep seeing invalid username or password when pushing images, stop blaming the registry and start blaming the login method. Plain text passwords are fragile and often do not play well with two factor setups and automated pipelines. Access tokens give you a revocable, auditable credential that works cleanly with docker login and reduces mysterious CI failures.</p>

<h2>Quick steps to swap to a token based workflow</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Create a token on Docker Hub</strong>
    <p>Open your Docker Hub account settings and go to the security area then generate a new access token. Give it a clear name so future you does not spend ten minutes guessing what prod CI1 was for.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Login with the token</strong>
    <p>Pipe the token into docker login to avoid leaking it in shell history or logs.</p>
    <pre><code>echo "ACCESS_TOKEN" | docker login --username USERNAME --password-stdin</code></pre>
    <p>Use your Docker Hub account name for USERNAME not your email address.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Update CI and local credential stores</strong>
    <p>Replace old passwords with the token in your CI secret variables. Many CI systems accept a secret named DOCKERHUB_TOKEN or something similar. On developer machines update the credential helper or OS keychain entry so docker can find the token when it needs it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify push and pull</strong>
    <p>Run docker push and docker pull on a repository that requires authentication. If both succeed you solved the invalid username or password error. If not, check the username spelling and that the token was copied correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revoke old credentials</strong>
    <p>If the old password was reused or a token might be compromised revoke it from the Docker Hub security page. Tokens are meant to be disposable so use that power responsibly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Troubleshooting and best practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use separate tokens for human developers and automated systems so you can rotate one without breaking the other.</li>
  <li>Rotate tokens regularly and store them in a secrets manager rather than environment variables sprinkled across jobs.</li>
  <li>Make sure your CI runner actually injects the secret and does not echo it into logs.</li>
  <li>If login still fails check for registry typos and network rules before assuming the token is bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Switching from passwords to access tokens is a small change that prevents a lot of pain in CI and local workflows. Follow the steps and you will have fewer login errors, fewer midnight firefights, and a better story for the next security audit.</p>
