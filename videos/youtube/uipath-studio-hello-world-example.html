  <h2>Why this tiny automation matters</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the thrilling world of RPA where your first victory is a popup that says hello. This tutorial walks a beginner through creating a simple UiPath Studio workflow that shows a Message Box with a Hello World greeting. It is short, practical, and gives you the confidence to break bigger things later in the name of automation.</p>

  <h3>What you will build</h3>
  <p>In plain terms you will create a Process project in UiPath Studio, add a Sequence to hold the flow, drop in a Message Box activity, set its Text to "Hello World", and run the workflow to see the popup. Think of it as the training wheels of RPA. It still counts as progress.</p>

  <h3>Step by step for the impatient</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open UiPath Studio and choose Process from the start screen. Give the project a name like HelloWorld and click Create to generate the workspace.</li>
    <li>In the Project panel open Main.xaml or make a new Sequence from the New menu. A Sequence gives a simple linear flow that beginners can actually follow.</li>
    <li>Open the Activities panel and search for Message Box. Drag the Message Box activity into your Sequence where a friendly popup belongs.</li>
    <li>Select the Message Box activity and set the Text property to "Hello World". This string is what will appear when the workflow runs so pick something mildly charming or at least functional.</li>
    <li>Press Run in the ribbon. A Message Box window will appear showing the greeting. Close the popup to finish the run and check the output logs if you want to feel slightly more professional.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Why use Message Box and when to switch</h3>
  <p>Message Box is great for learning and debugging because it forces you to watch the UI interact with something. For real logging prefer Write Line which keeps things tidy in the background. Use variables instead of hard coded text when you want the Hello World moment to grow into a helpful automation.</p>

  <h3>Quick tips to level up</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Swap the literal "Hello World" with a variable and use Assign to set it. That is the first step toward dynamic messages and real workflows.</li>
    <li>Wrap UI actions in a Try Catch to avoid rude crashes when the element you expect goes on vacation.</li>
    <li>Use Arguments when you want to pass values between workflows and stop copy pasting like a caveman.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Recap You created a Process, added a Sequence, used a Message Box, and ran a workflow. You now have a working UiPath Studio Hello World that proves automation does not have to be terrifying. Enjoy the popup while it still obeys you.</p>
