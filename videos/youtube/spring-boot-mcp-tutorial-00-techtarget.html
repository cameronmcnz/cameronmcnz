<p>If you want a Spring Boot MCP project that does more than collect dust on a drive somewhere this guide will get you from empty folder to a runnable microservices layout without the usual surprise failures. Think scaffold then configure then test and breathe quietly when the logs are green.</p>

<h2>Why MCP and why care</h2>
<p>MCP style projects help you split a monolith into modules that make sense to humans and DevOps. You get clearer boundaries, easier testing, and fewer messages from coworkers that start with please help. This tutorial focuses on Spring Boot with Java and covers common build tools like Maven and Gradle so you can pick your weapon of choice.</p>

<h2>Scaffold the project</h2>
<p>Create a Spring Boot application with a modular package layout that matches MCP expectations. Keep module names explicit so future you does not spend an entire afternoon guessing what core or service means. Choose dependencies for web, JPA or your datastore adapter, actuator, and test support.</p>

<h3>Project layout suggestions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>core or common for shared utilities and configuration</li>
  <li>api or web for controllers and HTTP concerns</li>
  <li>service for business logic</li>
  <li>persistence for JPA entities and repositories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configure modules and profiles</h2>
<p>Use Spring profiles and external property files to keep environment specific values out of the repo. Name profiles clearly so the configuration does not read like an archaeological report. Prefer environment variables for secrets and avoid committing passwords into version control so deployments have fewer drama moments.</p>

<h2>Implement controllers and services</h2>
<p>Let controllers handle HTTP concerns and keep database logic inside services or repositories. Single responsibility per class is not a fad. It is the difference between an app you can debug in a reasonable time and an app that makes you nostalgic for simpler errors.</p>

<h3>Testing the layers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unit test services with mocks for repositories</li>
  <li>Controller tests can use mocked service layers or slice testing</li>
  <li>Integration tests should wire real beans with an in memory database or test container</li>
</ul>

<h2>Persistence and repositories</h2>
<p>Pick a JPA provider or a datastore adapter and define clear domain entities. Create repository interfaces so data access is consistent across modules. If you use Spring Data JPA you get common CRUD wiring for free and fewer surprises when wiring transactions.</p>

<h2>Build run and verify</h2>
<p>Use Maven or Gradle to build with a local profile. Run integration scenarios and exercise endpoints to confirm module wiring behaves as expected. If tests pass you can relax a fraction of a percent. If not, logs plus actuator endpoints will be your friends.</p>

<h2>Test monitor and troubleshoot</h2>
<p>Write unit and integration tests and enable basic health checks. Use Spring Boot actuator endpoints to check health, metrics, and configuration properties at runtime. Logs help you find miswired beans or missing properties before a production user files a complaint that is politely worded but deadly.</p>

<h2>Quick checklist to avoid common traps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep configuration per profile and avoid committing secrets</li>
  <li>Keep controller logic thin and services responsible for business rules</li>
  <li>Define repository interfaces and domain entities clearly</li>
  <li>Run integration tests with the same profile you will run locally or in CI</li>
  <li>Enable actuator and a simple logging strategy for faster debugging</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps in order and keep configuration explicit. The goal is a modular Spring Boot MCP app that you can explain in an elevator speech and actually run without invoking mysterious stack traces. If you still hit trouble an extra test or a well placed log line will usually save the day or at least make the failure entertaining to debug.</p>
