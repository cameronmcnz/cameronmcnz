<h2>Why start a branch from another branch</h2>
<p>So you want a branch that borrows history from some other branch and behaves like it always belonged to that lineage. Good idea. This is a standard git branching task that keeps your work based on the exact commit you want. It is essential for clean feature work in version control and for a sane developer workflow.</p>

<h2>Refresh remote refs</h2>
<p>Before you try anything clever, make sure your local git knows what the remote thinks. Otherwise you will create a branch from an outdated commit and then explain yourself to the team.</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin</code></pre>
<p>This updates remote refs without touching your working tree. It is safe and boring in the best possible way.</p>

<h2>Switch to the base branch</h2>
<p>Pick the branch you want to base your new branch on and switch to it. You can use the classic command or the newer, slightly more polite command.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout other-branch
# or on newer Git versions
git switch other-branch</code></pre>
<p>Confirm the base branch contains the commit you want to inherit. If it does not, either wait or communicate. Merge conflicts do not respect schedules.</p>

<h2>Create the new branch from the chosen base</h2>
<p>Now create a branch that points at that base. You can create and check it out in one go. Pick whichever command makes you feel younger or more modern.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new-branch other-branch
# or
git switch -c new-branch other-branch
# if the base is only on the remote
git checkout -b new-branch origin/other-branch</code></pre>
<p>At this moment the new branch points to the tip of the chosen base. Congratulations, you have a child branch. Treat it nicely.</p>

<h2>Push the new branch to the remote</h2>
<p>Share the branch so collaborators can see your masterpiece or your mess. The upstream flag makes future life easier.</p>
<pre><code>git push -u origin new-branch
# after the first push you can just run
git push</code></pre>

<h2>Verify history and tidy up</h2>
<p>Look at the history to make sure you actually started where you thought you did. The graph view is compact and honest.</p>
<pre><code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate new-branch</code></pre>
<p>If the base has moved on since you started then rebase the feature branch onto the updated base. This keeps history linear and slightly less chaotic.</p>
<pre><code>git rebase other-branch</code></pre>

<h3>Quick workflow checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>git fetch origin to update remote refs</li>
  <li>git checkout other-branch or git switch other-branch to move to the base</li>
  <li>git checkout -b new-branch other-branch or git switch -c new-branch other-branch to create and check out</li>
  <li>git push -u origin new-branch to publish</li>
  <li>git log --oneline --graph --decorate new-branch to inspect</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final tips for developers</h3>
<p>If you need to delete a local branch after it is merged use git branch -d branch-name. If you need to remove a remote branch use git push origin --delete branch-name. Keep your branch names short and meaningful and write commit messages like you expect someone else to read them. Odds are they will.</p>
<p>This short git tutorial covers the practical git-commands you need for creating a branch from another branch in a reliable workflow. Follow these steps and you will avoid most awkward PR explanations.</p>
