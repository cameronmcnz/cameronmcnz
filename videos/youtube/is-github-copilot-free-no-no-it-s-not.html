<h2>Quick answer and who gets it free</h2>
<p>Short answer No GitHub Copilot is not universally free. Some people do get free access but most developers will hit a subscription at some point. Students and some open source maintainers have real routes to free access while teams usually pay for Copilot for Business seats. New users might see a trial window to test things first.</p>

<h2>Why everyone sees a free extension and gets confused</h2>
<p>The browser or editor extension can look like an open invitation. It is helpful and visible which makes it feel free. Under the hood the model is supported by paid subscriptions for sustained use. Think of the extension as a demo donut that convinces you to come back for the whole bakery.</p>

<h3>Key paid features to watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Copilot Chat and advanced interactive suggestions that go beyond simple completions</li>
  <li>Enhanced code suggestions and larger context windows for better accuracy</li>
  <li>Organization seat management and billing for teams</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to check your account status</h2>
<p>Don t panic and don t guess. Here are three simple steps that actually work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open your GitHub account settings</li>
  <li>Go to billing and plans and look for Copilot entries</li>
  <li>Read eligibility notes for student packs or open source maintainer grants</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organization manages billing ask your admin for clarity on seat allocation and renewal cycles. That person knows where the receipts live and how to avoid accidental developer doom.</p>

<h2>Who can get Copilot for free</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Verified students through the GitHub Student Developer Pack</li>
  <li>Maintainers of eligible open source projects under GitHub s support programs</li>
  <li>New users during short trial periods meant for evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips to get free or cheaper access</h2>
<p>If your budget is tight try these practical moves that do not involve witchcraft.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check student verification status if you are a student and apply for the Student Developer Pack</li>
  <li>Contribute to eligible open source projects and look for maintainer grants</li>
  <li>Ask your team lead for a trial pilot so you can measure real time saved before buying seats</li>
  <li>Use Copilot selectively for specific tasks to stretch a single seat further</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick cost and billing guide for teams</h2>
<p>Teams usually buy Copilot for Business seats and manage billing through organization settings. Track usage during a pilot and compare saved development hours to subscription costs. If you are the person who must justify the purchase, bring concrete metrics and a calm voice.</p>

<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>Copilot can be a time saver and a tiny tyrant depending on how you use it. Check billing and eligibility before assuming things are free. If you want free access try student verification or open source maintainer programs and always use trial time to measure value. That way you avoid surprises and keep your code and budget intact.</p>
