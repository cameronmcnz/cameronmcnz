<p>If you want cloud storage that behaves like a reasonable adult and not a digital hoarder then temporary S3 buckets and presigned URLs are your friends. This guide shows how to keep uploads short lived secure and tidy without turning your bill into a horror story.</p>

<h2>Why temporary buckets matter</h2>
<p>Temporary buckets are useful when you need to accept uploads or share downloads for a short time and you do not want those files lingering forever. Use lifecycle rules to expire objects automatically. Use tight access to reduce blast radius. Generate presigned URLs so clients do not need AWS credentials. Do the cleanup step so your cloud account does not become a museum of forgotten logs.</p>

<h2>Naming and lifecycle rules</h2>
<p>Pick a clear name that screams temporary. Examples include myapp temp uploads or myapp ephemeral transfer. That way humans and scripts know the object is not sacred.</p>
<p>Configure an S3 lifecycle rule to expire objects after the shortest practical window. Lifecycle will delete objects automatically after the age you choose. Note that lifecycle rules remove objects and their versions but do not delete the bucket itself. You will need a final cleanup step to remove the bucket once it is empty.</p>

<h3>Lifecycle tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Set noncurrent version expiration if versioning is on</li>
  <li>Use prefix filters so only temporary data gets deleted</li>
  <li>Test the rule on a small set before letting it loose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grant minimal permissions</h2>
<p>Do not give blanket permissions unless you enjoy Panic. Create a role or user that only has the actions needed for the task. For an upload endpoint give PutObject on the specific bucket and prefix. For download only give GetObject on the prefix. Keep the policy narrow and unglamorous.</p>
<p>Example in plain English for an IAM policy</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow actions: s3 PutObject and s3 GetObject as needed</li>
  <li>Apply resource: the specific bucket and prefix path star at the end</li>
  <li>Do not use wildcard bucket access across other buckets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generate presigned URLs</h2>
<p>Presigned URLs let a client upload or download without holding AWS keys. They expire after a set number of seconds and then stop working like a polite bouncer on an event night.</p>

<h3>CLI example</h3>
<p>Quick and dirty presign example using the AWS CLI</p>
<pre><code>aws s3 presign my-temp-bucket/path/to/object --expires-in 3600</code></pre>
<p>The command above produces a time limited URL. Share it with the client or use it in a browser or curl test. Set expires in to the shortest practical window.</p>

<h3>SDK usage in words</h3>
<p>In Python with boto3 call client generate presigned url with operation name get_object or put_object. Pass Params with Bucket and Key and set ExpiresIn to the number of seconds you want. In other SDKs the idea is the same. Use generate presigned post if you want browser friendly multipart form uploads.</p>

<h2>Test access and expected failures</h2>
<p>Test the URL in a browser or with curl. Upload and download should succeed while the URL is valid. After expiry you should see an access denied or other authentication error which means the URL did what it was supposed to do. If expired URLs still work then congratulations you have broken time itself and should fix your config.</p>

<h2>Cleanup and final checks</h2>
<p>When the temporary workflow is done remove objects and then delete the bucket. Lifecycle rules will handle most cleanup but do a final manual deletion step to ensure there are no leftover objects or versioned items preventing bucket removal. Remember if versioning is enabled you must delete object versions too.</p>

<h3>Checklist before you sleep</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Presigned URL expiry set to the shortest practical time</li>
  <li>Lifecycle rule targets only the temporary prefix</li>
  <li>IAM role or user has only the necessary actions</li>
  <li>Manual bucket removal step is in your runbook</li>
</ul>

<p>Temporary S3 storage is a small dose of order in an otherwise chaotic cloud life. Use short expiries narrow permissions and automated cleanup and you will avoid becoming the reason your team needs to explain a mysterious invoice.</p>
