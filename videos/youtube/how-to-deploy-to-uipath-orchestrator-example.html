<h2>Quick reality check</h2>
<p>If you are here you want to deploy a UiPath process to Orchestrator and actually have it run like an obedient robot instead of staging a drama. This guide walks through packaging publishing and deploying a process mapping robots to environments starting jobs and checking logs. No magic spells here just the RPA basics done right.</p>

<h2>Prepare your UiPath project</h2>
<p>Open your project in UiPath Studio and do the boring but necessary checks. Validate the main workflow confirm dependencies and set a clear version in project.json. Think of that version number as the label on a pizza box. No label means chaos at lunchtime and the same goes for production.</p>

<h3>Checklist to avoid messy deployments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the main entry file is correct</li>
  <li>Check package dependencies for compatibility</li>
  <li>Set a semantic version in project.json for traceability</li>
  <li>Test locally in a development environment before you touch production</li>
</ul>

<h2>Publish to the Orchestrator feed</h2>
<p>From UiPath Studio publish the package to the Orchestrator feed or a custom NuGet feed. Publishing uploads a NuGet package so Orchestrator can manage versions and deployments. Yes it creates a package and no you do not have to rename files by hand.</p>

<h2>Create the process in Orchestrator</h2>
<p>In Orchestrator either select the uploaded package or upload it again and choose the desired package version. Give the process a predictable name with a pattern that humans and search boxes both like. Predictability saves minutes and sometimes careers.</p>

<h3>Tips for naming and versioning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a consistent pattern that includes environment and component if helpful</li>
  <li>Adopt semantic versioning for clear updates and rollbacks</li>
  <li>Include a short description that mentions major changes in this release</li>
</ul>

<h2>Map robots to environments and assign the process</h2>
<p>Create an environment and add the robots that should run this process. Then create a process mapping that ties the package to the environment and defines the execution target. This avoids the classic why did that job land on a test machine moment.</p>

<h2>Start a job or schedule a trigger</h2>
<p>You can run the process immediately from the Processes area or create a trigger for scheduled runs. Use unattended robots for production automation and attended robots when human interaction is needed. Pick the right type or enjoy explaining a midnight alert to someone awake and confused.</p>

<h2>Monitor jobs and read the logs</h2>
<p>Use the Jobs and Logs pages in Orchestrator to monitor status codes review execution logs and download outputs. Filter logs to find exceptions faster than blaming the network. If a job failed check the exit code trace the activity and examine variable values saved in logs.</p>

<h3>What to check first when a job misbehaves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Job status and recent runs</li>
  <li>Execution logs for error messages and stack traces</li>
  <li>Robot availability and machine names</li>
  <li>Package version in the process mapping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final rules of engagement</h2>
<p>Keep versioning strict and naming predictable. Test deployments in a dev environment before promoting to production. Automate triggers only after successful test passes and keep a habit of tagging releases so you can roll back without drama. Follow these steps and your UiPath Orchestrator deployments will be less chaotic and slightly more heroic.</p>
