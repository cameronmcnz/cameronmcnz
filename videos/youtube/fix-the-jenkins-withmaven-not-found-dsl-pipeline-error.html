<h2>Why Jenkins lost withMaven and how to bring it home</h2>
<p>So your pipeline threw a tantrum and declared withMaven missing. That usually means the Pipeline Maven Integration plugin took a day off or your Maven tool was never invited to the party. This guide will walk you through the calm, mildly sarcastic steps to restore the withMaven DSL support and stop CI from acting like a rebellious teenager.</p>

<h2>Quick checklist to fix the error</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install the Pipeline Maven Integration plugin from Manage Plugins</li>
  <li>Restart Jenkins after plugin install</li>
  <li>Configure a Maven installation in Global Tool Configuration</li>
  <li>Wrap Maven stages in the withMaven wrapper in your pipeline</li>
  <li>Verify agent environment and plugin compatibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Install the plugin and restart</h3>
<p>Open Manage Jenkins then Manage Plugins and install Pipeline Maven Integration. After that perform a restart. The withMaven pipeline step comes from that plugin and it will not magically appear without it. A restart clears up classloader issues and helps Jenkins remember what plugins it has.</p>

<h3>Configure Maven in Global Tool Configuration</h3>
<p>Go to Manage Jenkins then Global Tool Configuration and add a Maven installation. Give it a clear name that your pipeline can reference. You can use the automatic installer or point to an existing Maven on the agent. The key is that Jenkins knows where Maven lives so the withMaven wrapper can pick it up.</p>

<h3>Update pipeline syntax to use the wrapper</h3>
<p>Wrap the stages that need Maven with withMaven so the pipeline can find Maven and collect reports. Here is an example declarative pipeline snippet for the attention impaired.</p>
<pre><code>pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage("Build") {
      steps {
        withMaven {
          sh "mvn -B -DskipTests clean package"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Restart and run the job</h3>
<p>After plugin or tool changes restart Jenkins and run the job. Check the console output for a line that shows withMaven running. If it still complains about missing tools look for messages about tools not found or incompatible plugin versions.</p>

<h3>Check agents and compatibility</h3>
<p>Confirm build agents have a compatible Java version and that Maven is either on the PATH or configured as a tool. Plugin mismatches with Jenkins core are a classic cause of nonsense errors. Update plugins if they look ancient and confirm the Pipeline Maven Integration plugin version works with your Jenkins version.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting tips that actually help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If withMaven is still missing enable verbose plugin logs and watch for classloader errors</li>
  <li>Verify the tool name in Global Tool Configuration matches what your pipeline expects</li>
  <li>Check agent logs for permission or PATH issues if Maven runs locally but not in pipeline</li>
  <li>Roll back recently updated plugins if the problem started after an update</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will restore withMaven DSL support without sacrificing a goat to the CI gods. If the step remains elusive you can paste console logs and we will stare at them together like two developers at 2 AM.</p>

<p>Tip If the withMaven step remains missing enable verbose plugin logs and double check that the Pipeline Maven Integration plugin is active</p>
