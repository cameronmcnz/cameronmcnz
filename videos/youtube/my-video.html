  <h2>Watch actively and mute the noise</h2>
  <p>Yes you will have to watch the clip more than once. This is a micro tutorial about extracting the main idea from a one minute video, not performing audiovisual heroics. Play the clip with attention, close the other tabs, and pretend your notes will someday be subpoenaed. Focus on repetition and emphasis. Speakers love repeating the important line like a broken record, and that is your treasure map.</p>

  <h2>Mark timestamps and visual cues</h2>
  <p>Jot down seconds where a key phrase appears or where the visuals shift. A few time marks save a lot of guessing later and make quoting painless. If the clip is 60 seconds long you can be picky and still finish before your coffee gets cold.</p>

  <h3>What to capture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exact seconds for the key claim</li>
    <li>Notable examples or data points</li>
    <li>Any call to action or next step</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Identify the main claim</h2>
  <p>Ask what the presenter wants you to remember. Pull out the central noun and verb that carry that message. Treat the presenter like a headline writer and strip away the fluff. This is the backbone of your video summary and the core of your content extraction workflow.</p>

  <h2>Condense that claim to one sentence</h2>
  <p>Combine the main claim with a clarifying phrase so the sentence fits on a sticky note but still helps someone. Short, punchy, and useful beats wordy and vague every time. This single sentence powers summary writing for descriptions, tweets, or internal notes.</p>

  <h2>Create two supporting bullets</h2>
  <p>Support the one sentence with a quick fact or example and one suggested action step. That gives context and utility without forcing anyone to binge the whole clip again.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evidence or example that proves the claim</li>
    <li>One next step for an interested viewer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use the transcript like a metal detector</h2>
  <p>If a transcript exists search for repeated nouns and verbs and highlight those lines. That finds the backbone of the message faster than heroic guessing. For productivity and visual learning this is the single best shortcut.</p>

  <h2>Quick recap for the impatient</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Watch actively</li>
    <li>Mark timestamps and cues</li>
    <li>Identify the main claim</li>
    <li>Write one sentence summary</li>
    <li>Add two supporting bullets</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Follow this process and you will turn short clips into usable notes. This method scales across micro tutorials and one minute videos, and it keeps creativity as the only real bottleneck. Now go summarize something and feel slightly more powerful than when you opened your fourth tab.</p>
