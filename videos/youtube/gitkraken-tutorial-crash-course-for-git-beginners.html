  <p>If you are new to Git and a visual Git client sounds like therapy, welcome. This guide shows how to use GitKraken to manage Git repositories without accidentally deleting the internet. You will learn to install and configure the client, open or clone projects, create branches, stage and commit changes, push and pull with remotes, merge and fix merge conflicts, and inspect history when things go sideways. All practical, no mysticism.</p>

  <h2>Install and configure GitKraken</h2>
  <p>Download GitKraken and sign in with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. In the preferences set your name and email so commits show the correct author instead of a cryptic handle you will regret later. Link any hosting services you use to get pull request and issue integration. This saves manual cross referencing and makes your commit history less lonely.</p>

  <h2>Open or clone a repository</h2>
  <p>Open a local folder or clone a remote repo from the client. The graph view shows branch relationships and commit ancestry, while the file tree reveals your working directory. If you ever feel lost, the graph is your map and not a bunch of squiggles meant to confuse you.</p>

  <h2>Create and work on branches</h2>
  <p>Create a branch from the branch menu or directly from the graph. Branches let you experiment in private, which is great for trying new features or breaking things intentionally. Name branches clearly so future you does not send angry emails.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use topic names like feature/login or fix/typo for clarity</li>
    <li>Switch branches with a click or the checkout action</li>
    <li>Keep the main branch protected and dramatic only in the commit messages</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stage changes and commit</h2>
  <p>Stage files by selecting them in the unstaged area. Write clear commit messages and press the commit button to record history. Think of each commit as a tiny time capsule you might have to explain to your team later. Use small, focused commits for easier review and rollback.</p>

  <h2>Push and pull with remotes</h2>
  <p>Push local commits to a remote to share work. Pull regularly to fetch teammates changes before merging. This reduces the chance of merge conflicts and the awkward conversation where everyone says they did not touch the same line. Use fetch when you want to inspect what others did without merging immediately.</p>

  <h2>Merge branches and resolve merge conflicts</h2>
  <p>Merge with drag and drop in the graph or use the merge action. When conflicts appear use the merge editor to pick changes and mark files as resolved. Commit the merge when you are done. If the conflict looks like a crime scene, take a deep breath and resolve one file at a time.</p>

  <h3>Quick conflict strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull remote changes before you start heavy merging work</li>
    <li>Use the merge editor to compare both sides and choose the right lines</li>
    <li>Test the result locally before pushing the merge</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Inspect history and undo safely</h2>
  <p>Use the history panel to explore the commit graph and checkout past commits when you need to inspect older code. Use revert to safely undo changes in public history. Reset can rewrite history but handle it with care, especially for branches others use. If you feel like rewriting the past, remember you might have to explain the revision in a pull request.</p>

  <h2>Connect remotes and services</h2>
  <p>Configure remotes in preferences and enable GitHub or GitLab integrations to link commits to pull requests and issues. This keeps context intact and reduces the need to juggle tabs like a stressed circus performer. Integrations also let you open PRs or view issues right from the client.</p>

  <h2>Useful Git commands to keep in your back pocket</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>git status to see what is up</li>
    <li>git add and git commit for local changes</li>
    <li>git fetch and git pull to sync with remotes</li>
    <li>git push to share your work</li>
    <li>git revert for safe undo of public commits</li>
    <li>git reset when you really know what you are doing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Troubleshooting tips</h2>
  <p>If the graph looks weird try fetching from the remote. If a merge goes wrong use the merge editor and test the build locally. If you accidentally rewrite public history recover by coordinating with your team and pushing the corrected state. Keep backups and branches until you are sure the change is solid.</p>

  <p>That wraps the crash course without the panic attack. Use GitKraken as your visual ally for version control, branching, and merge conflict triage. Practice makes cleaner history and fewer late night regret commits.</p>
