<h2>Why you might want to force a pull</h2>
<p>So the remote branch won a fight and your local copy lost. Before you panic and throw your keyboard out the window there is a sane way to make your working tree match the remote remote while keeping a way to recover any stray work. This guide covers git fetch, git reset, stash and backup branches so you can force a remote overwrite without the usual drama.</p>

<h2>Check the scene</h2>
<p>First look around with <code>git status</code>. If the working tree is clean then you are already in a good place. If not do not act like a reckless pirate. Decide whether those local edits are trash or treasure.</p>

<h2>Save or hide your local work</h2>
<p>If you care about the local changes make a quick backup branch with a normal commit or stash them for later. Both are fast and reversible.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a backup branch with a commit <code>git add -A</code> then <code>git commit -m "WIP backup"</code> and <code>git checkout -b my-backup-branch</code></li>
  <li>Or stash the changes with <code>git stash push -m backup</code> for a lightweight rescue option</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bring the remote refs down</h2>
<p>Do not use a mythical force pull command. Instead fetch the remote refs first so you can inspect what will happen.</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin</code></pre>
<p>This updates <code>origin/branch-name</code> without touching your working tree. Think of it as reconnaissance before the strike.</p>

<h2>Make your branch match remote</h2>
<p>Once you have a backup and you know which remote branch to follow run a hard reset to make your local branch exactly match the remote. Replace <code>main</code> with the branch you actually care about.</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard origin/main</code></pre>
<p>This replaces local commits and your working tree with the remote snapshot. No, it will not kindly ask permission. That is why we made backups.</p>

<h2>Remove untracked clutter if needed</h2>
<p>If you still see stray files use git clean to tidy up. Always do a dry run unless you enjoy unexpected file deletions.</p>
<pre><code>git clean -nd</code>

git clean -fd</code></pre>

<h2>Quick recovery tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you used a backup branch you can switch back with <code>git checkout my-backup-branch</code></li>
  <li>If you stashed changes use <code>git stash list</code> then <code>git stash apply</code> or <code>git stash pop</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Common pitfalls and how to avoid them</h2>
<p>Do not assume main is the right branch. Replace it with your feature branch name. Check <code>git remote -v</code> if you are not sure which origin you are talking to. Remember that a hard reset rewrites your local history so backups are not optional unless you want to gamble with lost commits.</p>

<h2>Recap for the impatient</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run <code>git status</code> and decide if local work matters</li>
  <li>Make a backup branch or stash local changes</li>
  <li>Fetch remote refs with <code>git fetch origin</code></li>
  <li>Force local branch to match remote with <code>git reset --hard origin/your-branch</code></li>
  <li>Clean untracked files with <code>git clean -fd</code> after a dry run</li>
</ol>

<p>There you go. You forced a remote overwrite and you still have a path to recover if something went sideways. Version control is supposed to make you feel clever not helpless. Now go write code and stop arguing with Git.</p>
