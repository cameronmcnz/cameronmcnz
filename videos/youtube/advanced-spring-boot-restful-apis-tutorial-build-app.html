<h2>Quick warning and what you will get</h2>
<p>If you like clean code and small surprises in production then this guide is for you. We will build a Spring Boot web app using a layered architecture that keeps controllers thin and service logic sensible. Expect Spring Boot starters for web data and security, DTOs to stop data leaks, repositories with Spring Data JPA, and a pragmatic take on validation and security testing. Also expect a few sarcastic comments to keep you awake.</p>

<h2>Project setup and dependencies</h2>
<p>Start with Maven or Gradle and add the usual Spring Boot starters for web data and security. Configure database connection and application properties so you do not discover runtime surprises at 3 AM. Use H2 for local experiments and switch to Postgres or MySQL for real life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spring Boot web starter for REST APIs</li>
  <li>Spring Data JPA for persistence and repository patterns</li>
  <li>Spring Security for auth and endpoint protection</li>
  <li>Validation api and Jackson for JSON mapping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design data model and DTOs</h2>
<p>Model your entities with @Entity and map relationships only when needed. Create DTOs for inputs and outputs so internal fields do not accidentally become public gossip. DTOs are the polite bouncers of your API. Map between entity and DTO in the service layer or use a mapper library if you like boilerplate reduction.</p>

<h3>Why DTOs matter</h3>
<p>They prevent leaking sensitive fields, stabilize your API contract, and make versioning less painful. If a client asks for fields you do not want to expose then DTOs will save you from awkward conversations.</p>

<h2>Persistence with Spring Data JPA</h2>
<p>Define repository interfaces that extend JpaRepository and leverage derived query methods whenever possible. When a derived query becomes a horror show use @Query or a Criteria builder. Keep transactions around use @Transactional on service methods that modify data and let Spring manage rollback on exceptions.</p>

<h2>Service layer and business logic</h2>
<p>Services orchestrate repository calls, convert entities to DTOs and enforce business rules. Keep controllers focused on web concerns and tests will be easier to write. Use constructor injection and avoid static state unless you enjoy debugging ghosts.</p>

<h2>Controllers and REST endpoints</h2>
<p>Use @RestController for JSON endpoints and map routes to small handler methods that return ResponseEntity. Validate incoming payloads in controllers using @Valid and let the service layer do the heavy lifting. Never return raw entity objects directly to clients unless your API is actually a confession booth.</p>

<h2>Validation and error handling</h2>
<p>Apply Bean Validation annotations like @NotNull and @Size on DTO fields. Consolidate exception handling with a controller advice so validation errors and business errors look consistent. A good error response saves developer time and user patience, which is priceless.</p>

<h2>Security testing and deployment</h2>
<p>Add Spring Security with JWT or basic auth depending on your threat model. Test authentication flows with Postman or curl and write integration tests for protected endpoints. Package the app as a JAR or container image and deploy to your cloud provider. Monitor auth failures and lock down any endpoints that get too chatty.</p>

<h3>Checklist before going live</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Credentials and secrets are not in source control</li>
  <li>Endpoints have proper authorization rules</li>
  <li>Validation catches bad input and returns useful messages</li>
  <li>Database transactions behave as expected</li>
  <li>Logging and monitoring are enabled for security events</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and your Spring Boot REST APIs will be reliable, testable, and slightly less likely to surprise you at midnight. If something goes wrong you at least get to say you followed best practices before blaming the network.
