<p>When the traffic signals decide to take a nap, you do not have to reinvent driving. This guide to lights out driving blends intersection safety, defensive driving, and a tiny bit of common sense. Read on and you might avoid a tow truck, a lecture from your insurance company, and the kind of paperwork that ruins weekends.</p>

<h2>Slow down and cover the brake</h2>
<p>Approach the intersection with reduced speed. That gives you time to see hazards and actually stop if another vehicle ignores the situation. Keep a foot hovering over the brake so you do not have to perform a surprise omelette with your dashboard.</p>

<h2>Scan and communicate</h2>
<p>Look left, right and center for cars, pedestrians and cyclists. Visibility may be poor at night, so use your hazard lights to announce you are paying attention. If safe and legal, a quick flash of the headlights helps other drivers locate you. This is not a rave, it is hazard avoidance.</p>

<h2>Treat the intersection like a four way stop</h2>
<p>When traffic signals fail, the intersection defaults to a four way stop rule for most driver education courses and road safety guidance. The vehicle that arrives first has the right of way. If two vehicles arrive together yield to the vehicle on your right. If three or more cars arrive in a pile up of indecision, proceed in turn with caution and mutual comprehension, not bravado.</p>

<h2>Use signals and make eye contact</h2>
<p>Turn signals win over honking and theatrics. A clear signal and a steady slow move tells other drivers you know what you are doing. Make eye contact when possible so everyone can negotiate movement without a soap opera. If someone refuses to meet your gaze, assume they are lost or texting and give them space.</p>

<h2>Proceed only when the way is clear</h2>
<p>Enter the crossing slowly and be prepared to stop mid maneuver. Defensive driving is boring but effective. If a vehicle moves unpredictably or a pedestrian steps out, you want time to react. This is about avoiding collisions and a very bad morning.</p>

<h3>Quick checklist for lights out driving</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slow down and cover the brake</li>
  <li>Scan the intersection left right and center</li>
  <li>Use hazard lights and flash headlamps if needed</li>
  <li>Treat it as a four way stop and follow right of way rules</li>
  <li>Signal clearly and seek eye contact</li>
  <li>Proceed slowly and be ready to stop</li>
</ul>

<p>Final tip for night driving and bad weather assume the worst and wait for a safe gap. That extra second of patience is cheaper than a tow and avoids the kind of paperwork that makes grown adults grieve. Follow these steps and you will improve intersection safety, practice better defensive driving, and live to roll your eyes at traffic stories another day.</p>
