  <p>If Git snarls and throws a fatal setting SSL certificate error when you try to clone, congratulations. You have joined a long line of developers who forgot that trust is a thing computers care about a lot more than coworkers do. This guide will walk you through diagnosing the cause and fixing it properly so you are not forever bypassing security like a developer on a deadline.</p>

  <h2>Step 1 Diagnose the error and read the message</h2>
  <p>First rule of debugging trust problems is to read what Git tells you. The full error message will usually say whether the certificate chain failed validation or if something in the middle like a corporate proxy presented a different cert. Reproduce the problem with the exact command you tried so you have the same output to work from.</p>

  <h3>What to look for</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hostname mismatch messages that say the certificate does not match the host</li>
    <li>Unknown certificate authority errors that mean the issuer is not trusted</li>
    <li>Proxy or MITM hints such as corporate CA names in the chain</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2 Use the system CA bundle so Git trusts the same roots as the OS</h2>
  <p>Git relies on the transport backend to validate TLS. Pointing Git to your operating system CA bundle avoids half baked fixes.</p>
  <p>Example command to point Git at a CA bundle file</p>
  <pre><code>git config --global http.sslCAInfo /path/to/ca-bundle.crt</code></pre>
  <p>On some platforms you may also need to ensure that Git is using the curl backend that respects that setting. If you are on a distro that maintains a central CA store follow the OS specific steps below instead of repeatedly setting a file path.</p>

  <h2>Step 3 Test with a temporary verify bypass for troubleshooting only</h2>
  <p>There is a clear shortcut that everybody remembers when they panic. Use it only to confirm that certificate validation is the blocker and then undo it immediately.</p>
  <pre><code>git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://example.com/repo.git</code></pre>
  <p>Yes it works sometimes. No you should not leave it enabled globally or on servers. That setting tells Git to pretend certificate validation is optional which it is not.</p>

  <h2>Step 4 Install a private CA into the system trust store</h2>
  <p>If your network uses a private certificate authority or a proxy that injects certificates, add that CA to the OS trust store so validation succeeds like a grown up.</p>

  <h3>Linux</h3>
  <p>Copy the PEM file to your distribution trust directory and update the trust database. On Debian and Ubuntu type</p>
  <pre><code>sudo cp myca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates</code></pre>
  <p>Other distros have similar workflows. The goal is to make the CA available system wide so curl and Git accept it.</p>

  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p>Import the certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store for the current user or machine. Use the Certificate Manager UI or certutil depending on your taste for GUI versus regret.</p>

  <h3>macOS</h3>
  <p>Add the certificate to the login or system keychain and mark it as trusted. You can use the Keychain Access app or the command line security tool to automate the step.</p>

  <h2>Step 5 Capture the server chain when behind a corporate proxy</h2>
  <p>If you suspect a proxy is rewriting certificates, grab the chain directly with OpenSSL to see what servers really present.</p>
  <pre><code>openssl s_client -showcerts -connect host.example.com:443</code></pre>
  <p>Look at the chain for the intermediate and root issuers. Add only the missing CA to your trust store. Do not add random certificates unless you enjoy helping attackers and paperwork.</p>

  <h2>Recap and a small checklist so you sleep better</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reproduce the error and read it line by line</li>
    <li>Prefer system CA bundles over ad hoc file hacks</li>
    <li>Use a temporary http.sslVerify=false only for testing</li>
    <li>Install private CAs in the OS trust store for permanent fixes</li>
    <li>When behind proxies capture the chain with openssl and add only the missing trust</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If this all sounds like overkill you are correct and also still wrong. Certificate validation exists to protect your code and your users. Fix the trust properly and you will get day passes back to secure land where clones work and you do not have to explain to ops why the server is ignoring TLS.</p>
