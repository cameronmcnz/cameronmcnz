<p>If you think version control is a dark art performed by wizards, this guide is your flashlight and occasional sarcastic sidekick. We will use Git and the GitKraken git gui to clone repos create branches stage and commit changes push branches open pull requests and handle the tiny melodramas called merge conflicts. No ritual sacrifices required.</p>

<h2>Install and configure Git and GitKraken</h2>
<p>Install Git on your machine and install GitKraken. Sign into GitKraken with your Git hosting account so the app can talk to your remote repository. Run these in a terminal to set identity if you like readable blame histories</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></li>
  <li><code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the global user name and email avoids commit messages that look like they were written by a mystery ghost.</p>

<h2>Clone or open a repository in the GUI</h2>
<p>Use the clone dialog or open a local folder. GitKraken will draw the history graph so you can stop guessing which branch hid that one weird change. If your remote requires credentials follow the host prompts to connect your account.</p>

<h2>Create a feature branch and switch to it</h2>
<p>Pick a descriptive branch name that explains the work. Keep it readable like feature/login-button bugfix/login-crash or chore/update-deps. Creating and switching branches in the GUI is a click away and the working tree updates so you can start editing without ceremony.</p>

<h2>Edit files stage hunks and write useful commits</h2>
<p>Edit code in your favorite editor then return to GitKraken to stage chunks or whole files. The ability to stage individual hunks is great when your brain decided to solve two problems in one edit. Commit messages should explain the why not just the what. Future you and the person doing code review will thank you between sips of coffee.</p>

<h2>Push your branch and open a pull request</h2>
<p>Push upstream with one click and open a pull request on the hosting service. Use pull request templates and request reviewers so the change does not float around like a lost balloon. Add a clear description include testing notes and mention any related issue numbers to speed up reviews.</p>

<h2>Resolve merge conflicts without panic</h2>
<p>When conflicts show up use GitKraken conflict tools to choose lines or edit manually. Test locally after resolving then commit the resolution. Remember that conflicts are normal and not a personal failing. If you need a safe reset use the history graph or undo tools to back out changes cleanly.</p>

<h2>Use the history graph and undo features</h2>
<p>The visual history graph is useful for understanding where a change came from and who pushed it. GitKraken also exposes common undo patterns like revert and reset in a UI friendly way. Learn the difference between reset and revert so you do not surprise your teammates or yourself on a late night push.</p>

<h3>Quick checklist for new developers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install Git and sign into GitKraken with your host account</li>
  <li>Clone or open the repo in the GUI</li>
  <li>Create a clear feature branch and switch to it</li>
  <li>Stage sensible hunks and write commit messages that explain the why</li>
  <li>Push and open a pull request with reviewers and a description</li>
  <li>Use the conflict editor to resolve merges then commit the result</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and GitKraken will stop feeling like a foreign language interpreter that only accepts ancient runes. You will still make mistakes but the GUI and history tools make recovery less dramatic and far more professional. Now go make a small safe change and pretend you meant it.</p>
