<p>If you want your coding flow to feel less like a traffic jam and more like a scenic cruise then GitHub Copilot is the polite intern that writes the boilerplate while you solve the real problems. This guide covers how to get useful code suggestions with Copilot while staying in charge of architecture and edge cases. Think of Copilot as pair programming with an overconfident assistant that is often right but still needs a human reviewer.</p>

<h2>Set up context and prompts</h2>
<p>Good context makes the difference between a helpful suggestion and a hallucination. Place clear function names comments and example inputs near the cursor. The more surrounding code you give Copilot the better its suggestions will match your intent and project style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give short examples for expected inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Add descriptive names to functions and variables</li>
<li>Include relevant imports and types when possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use inline suggestions and accept wisely</h2>
<p>Copilot will happily fill in the obvious stuff. Read each suggestion before accepting. It nails boilerplate scenarios but can miss corner cases or project naming conventions. Accept only after a quick sanity check and a confirm that tests will catch regressions.</p>

<h2>Run tests and iterate fast</h2>
<p>Write a small test that demonstrates expected behavior and run it right away. Fast feedback catches logic errors and keeps the momentum. If a suggestion breaks a test you can iterate with a focused prompt to fix the failing case.</p>

<h3>Good test driven habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create minimal reproducible examples for tricky bugs</li>
<li>Keep unit tests fast so you can run them often</li>
<li>Use test failures to craft better prompts for Copilot</li>
</ul>

<h2>Refactor and ask for improvements</h2>
<p>Short prompts near a function can produce alternative implementations or simpler logic. Ask Copilot for more readable code or performance tweaks. Always compare the suggested approach to your design constraints before merging.</p>

<h2>Document and review generated code</h2>
<p>Add comments and update documentation after accepting suggestions. Automated code suggestions do not replace code review. Human review prevents surprises and keeps quality high.</p>

<h2>Quick workflow checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prepare minimal example and context</li>
<li>Use inline suggestions and inspect them</li>
<li>Run tests and iterate fast</li>
<li>Refactor with short prompts</li>
<li>Document and perform code review</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these habits and Copilot will handle the routine work while you focus on design and tricky cases. It will not replace your brain but it will buy you extra time for coffee and creative problem solving.</p>
