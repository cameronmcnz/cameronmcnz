<p>So you built a feature branch, fixed a bug, and now you want to get rid of the evidence. Good. This guide walks through removing a Git branch on your machine and telling the remote to forget it too. It keeps the facts straight and the drama low.</p>

<h2>Before you delete a branch</h2>
<p>Deleting branches is easy and permanent enough to be fun if you enjoy surprises. Do these checks first so the surprise is a pleasant one.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm you are not on the branch you want to delete</li>
  <li>Make sure any important work is merged or backed up</li>
  <li>Check branch protection rules on your remote hosting service</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switch away from the target branch</h2>
<p>Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently using. So switch to a safe place first like main or develop. Pick whatever branch your team actually uses for shipping.</p>
<pre><code>git switch main</code></pre>

<h2>Delete the local branch safely</h2>
<p>Use the safe delete command when you want Git to protect you from losing commits. This command refuses to delete branches that contain commits not merged anywhere else.</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d feature-name</code></pre>
<p>If Git says the branch is not fully merged then you either need to merge it or be certain you want to lose the commits.</p>

<h2>Force delete when you know what you are doing</h2>
<p>Okay bold move. If you are absolutely sure the branch is expendable use the force delete. This nukes the branch locally even if commits would be orphaned.</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D feature-name</code></pre>
<p>Use this with care and maybe a small prayer to the version control gods.</p>

<h2>Remove the branch on the remote</h2>
<p>Tell the remote to drop the branch. This is just a push that deletes a ref on the server. If it fails inspect permissions and branch protection rules on your hosting service.</p>
<pre><code>git push origin --delete feature-name</code></pre>

<h2>Prune stale remote references</h2>
<p>After deleting a remote branch your local clone may still list it until you clean up stale refs. Run one of these to keep your branch list honest.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>git remote prune origin</code> to remove stale refs now</li>
  <li><code>git fetch --prune</code> to fetch and prune in one go</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verify what remains</h2>
<p>Want to double check before you celebrate The Vanishing Branch Use this to list local and remote branches with details.</p>
<pre><code>git branch -av</code></pre>

<h3>Quick safety tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a lightweight backup tag if you want to be extra cautious</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git tag backup/feature feature-name</code></pre>

<p>One final thought Keep a calm checklist and confirm branch names before running destructive commands. That small pause saves you from a frantic revert later and maybe from explaining the mistake in a team meeting.</p>
