<h2>Ready to run Jenkins on Windows 10 without drama</h2>
<p>If you want a reliable Jenkins server for CI CD and automation on Windows 10, this guide gets you there without the usual forehead slaps. You will install Java, run the Jenkins MSI, unlock the instance, add plugins and create an admin user. No mysterious sacrifices required, just a few clicks and some environment variable etiquette.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supported Java runtime, either a JDK or JRE. Jenkins needs Java to live.</li>
  <li>Administrator access on the Windows 10 machine for installing services and opening ports.</li>
  <li>Basic network access for plugin downloads and agent communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 Install Java</h2>
<p>Jenkins runs on Java, so install a supported JDK or JRE first. After installing, set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Java folder. Many Jenkins startup failures come from a missing Java setup, or a Java version that looks fine until it does not.</p>

<h2>Step 2 Download the Jenkins MSI</h2>
<p>Grab the Windows MSI from the official Jenkins download page and pick the LTS build for stability. If you prefer living on the edge, pick a weekly release but expect surprises. The MSI is Windows friendly and will register Jenkins as a service during installation.</p>

<h2>Step 3 Run the installer as administrator</h2>
<p>Right click the MSI and run with elevated privileges. The installer will create a Windows service, open the default port for you, and ask about firewall rules. Say yes to the firewall prompt unless you like firewall fights.</p>

<h2>Step 4 Unlock Jenkins and finish setup</h2>
<p>On first launch Jenkins writes an initial admin password to a secrets file under Program Files Jenkins secrets initialAdminPassword. Open that file, paste the password into the web setup and continue. From there you can install the suggested plugins and create your first admin account.</p>

<h3>Why use the suggested plugin set</h3>
<p>The suggested set gives you a practical CI platform fast. It includes common pieces for pipelines, source control, and agents. You can always prune or add plugins later from the plugin manager.</p>

<h2>Step 5 Verify the Windows service and the web dashboard</h2>
<p>Check the Services control panel for the Jenkins service and make sure it is running. Open the local host dashboard shown by the installer in your browser and sign in with the admin user you created. If you see the Jenkins blue ball or a friendly dashboard, congratulations. If you see errors, the troubleshooting section below helps.</p>

<h2>Step 6 Run a quick job to confirm CI CD basics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create a simple freestyle job or a basic pipeline that prints a hello message.</li>
  <li>Run the job to confirm the master can execute builds and that agents can be registered later.</li>
  <li>Check logs and console output when things do not work as expected. The logs are helpful and less judgmental than your coworkers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting and tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If Jenkins fails to start, recheck <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and the Java version.</li>
  <li>If plugins fail to download, verify outbound network access and proxy settings if your environment uses one.</li>
  <li>Keep admin and user passwords strong. If you use guessable passwords expect curious visitors and bad ideas.</li>
  <li>For production use consider backing up the Jenkins home folder and configuring service recovery options in Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>This walkthrough covered Java prep, the MSI install, unlocking Jenkins, suggested plugins, user creation, and quick verification steps. You should now have a working Jenkins instance on Windows 10 ready for pipelines, automation, and mild domination of your CI CD workflow.</p>
