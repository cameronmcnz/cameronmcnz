<h2>Quick install and first run</h2>
<p>Unpack the right installer for Windows or Mac and run the normal installer. No secret rituals required. Once the app is on your machine sign in with your Anthropic Claude account and pick a theme that does not hurt your eyes. Toggle notification and privacy settings so the assistant only nags you about useful stuff.</p>

<h2>Choose the right model and manage memory</h2>
<p>Claude Desktop lets you pick model settings and memory snippets that shape how the AI thinks and remembers. Think of memory snippets as sticky notes the assistant carries between sessions. Keep them short and specific to save time and avoid rambling answers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a model that matches your needs from fast reply to deeper reasoning</li>
  <li>Use short memory snippets for recurring context like role instructions or project details</li>
  <li>Trim or archive old memory snippets to prevent context bloat</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use the composer and build workflows that behave</h2>
<p>The composer is where prompts get refined and where you actually get work done. Compose. Test. Tweak. Chain tasks into workflows to automate multi step jobs like research then drafting then summarizing. Sessions let you run parallel threads for separate projects without cross talk.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a prompt template for common tasks and save it as a workflow</li>
  <li>Chain steps so the assistant can fetch context produce an outline and then expand into a draft</li>
  <li>Keep one session per project so history stays relevant and tidy</li>
</ol>

<h3>Keyboard shortcuts and quick moves</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are the productivity steroids nobody tells you about. Try Ctrl K or Cmd K to jump to the composer. Assign hotkeys to your most used templates and stop wasting time with mouse hunting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl K or Cmd K for quick search and jump</li>
  <li>Ctrl Enter or Cmd Enter to send without leaving your flow</li>
  <li>Set hotkeys for templates you use daily like meeting notes or email drafts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting results and automating repetition</h2>
<p>When the assistant gives you something useful export it. Copy raw text save as a file or push content into other apps through the integrations the desktop app supports. Use workflows to automate repetitive exports so you do not end up doing boring copy paste for hours.</p>

<h2>Productivity tips that actually help</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep memory snippets brief for faster and more focused replies</li>
  <li>Use templates for repeatable tasks and refine them after a few runs</li>
  <li>Split big jobs into workflow steps so you can audit output at each stage</li>
  <li>Archive sessions when a project ends to keep your workspace clean</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you go from fresh install to tuned Anthropic Claude desktop assistant without wasting hours on guesswork. The app handles the heavy lifting if you set sensible defaults and use workflows. Now go tame your inbox or write that draft while the assistant does the boring scaffolding.</p>
