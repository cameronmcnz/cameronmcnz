<h2>Quick overview of publishing to Orchestrator</h2>
<p>If you want your RPA automation to behave in production and not stage a dramatic exit, you need a repeatable publish and deploy flow. This guide walks through preparing a UiPath Studio project publishing the package to Orchestrator verifying the upload creating a process assigning an environment and running the job with sane monitoring. No drama just versioning and sanity checks.</p>

<h3>Prepare your UiPath Studio project</h3>
<p>Think of this step as packing a suitcase for a business trip rather than a road trip with questionable decisions. Clean unused dependencies verify project.json has the right version and description and remove packages that serve no purpose. Add meaningful logging in key workflows so you can actually know what broke when it does.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check project.json version and description for clarity</li>
  <li>Remove unused packages to avoid dependency surprises</li>
  <li>Keep logs informative and scoped to steps that matter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configure the Orchestrator connection and runtime</h3>
<p>Registration depends on your architecture. Use a machine and classic folders for legacy setups or modern folders for cloud native style deployments. Create a robot and map it to a machine or a machine template. Add credentials and any assets the process needs to run. Doing this now saves time when you assign processes to environments later.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decide modern folders or classic based on governance and scale</li>
  <li>Create robots and assign machine or template according to your topology</li>
  <li>Store credentials and assets in Orchestrator so runtime has everything it needs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Publish the package from UiPath Studio</h3>
<p>Hit Publish in Studio and choose Orchestrator as the destination. Use a clear package name and a sensible version number. Treat versioning like insurance for rollbacks and blameless postmortems. If you ever need to unroll a change you will thank your past self.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Publish and choose Orchestrator as destination</li>
  <li>Follow naming standards for package names for easier searching</li>
  <li>Pick a version that follows your release policy such as major dot minor dot patch</li>
</ol>

<h3>Verify the package in Orchestrator</h3>
<p>Open Packages in Orchestrator and confirm the package appears with the expected version. Check package size and listed dependencies. If something looks off do not deploy higher environments. Investigate the artifact rather than delivering surprises to production.</p>

<h3>Create the process and map to environment</h3>
<p>Create a process from the uploaded package and map that process to an environment. Choose the correct robot type set runtime parameters and wire up asset references. Environments determine which robots are eligible to run a given process so pick the environment that matches your target machines.</p>

<h3>Run the job and monitor execution</h3>
<p>Start a job directly from Orchestrator or create a scheduled trigger. Watch execution logs queue items and job output from the dashboard. Use logs to triage failures update the package and republish as needed. If a run fails repeatedly roll back to the previous version while you fix the issue.</p>

<h2>Quick checklist before you publish</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project.json updated with meaningful version and description</li>
  <li>No unused packages or hidden dependencies</li>
  <li>Robots machines and modern folders configured in Orchestrator</li>
  <li>Credentials and assets present and tested</li>
  <li>Clear package naming and versioning policy followed</li>
  <li>Monitoring and logging in place for post deploy validation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you follow these steps you will have a reproducible deployment flow that plays nicely with UiPath Orchestrator and keeps automation running instead of staging a spontaneous meltdown. Automation is supposed to save time not cause meetings.</p>
