<p>So you want an Orchestrator tenant without the usual drama and late night panics. Good choice. This guide walks you from zero to a working UiPath Orchestrator tenant on Automation Cloud with practical notes that actually matter.</p>

<h2>Quick start checklist for Orchestrator registration</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create or sign in to a UiPath account with your business email</li>
  <li>Confirm your email to unlock organization setup</li>
  <li>Create an Organization and provision an Orchestrator tenant</li>
  <li>Add users and assign roles like Administrator and Developer</li>
  <li>Download the Robot or Studio installer and connect machines using the machine key and tenancy URL</li>
</ul>

<h2>Access Automation Cloud</h2>
<p>Open the UiPath Automation Cloud portal in a browser. This is the web hub where you create organizations and tenants and where Orchestrator lives. Yes it sounds obvious, but do not skip the step of using a business email for production use. Trial accounts sometimes work with personal emails but you will save time later if you use a company address now.</p>

<h2>Create an account and verify</h2>
<p>Create or sign in to your UiPath account. You will receive a verification email that includes a link. Click that link and take a deep breath. Once verified you can proceed to create an Organization and provision an Orchestrator tenant from the Automation Cloud dashboard.</p>

<h3>Provisioning the tenant</h3>
<p>From the dashboard choose to create an Organization and follow the prompts to add an Orchestrator tenant for your team or project. A tenant groups users robots processes and assets so treat it like a container for access and resources. If your project will have separate teams consider multiple tenants now instead of untangling permissions later.</p>

<h2>Configure users and roles</h2>
<p>Add users and assign roles such as Administrator and Developer. Best practice is to use a dedicated admin account for tenant setup and separate service accounts for robots. That keeps permissions tidy and limits accidental chaos when someone uninstalls or renames things.</p>

<h3>Recommended role setup</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Administrator for tenant owners and infra people</li>
  <li>Developer for automation builders</li>
  <li>Service accounts for unattended robots</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download and connect Robot or Studio</h2>
<p>From the portal download the Robot or Studio installer and run it on the target machine. During configuration you will be asked for a machine key and the tenancy URL. Copy those from the Automation Cloud tenant page and paste them into the connector setup. Once the machine registers assign the robot to the appropriate environment and user.</p>

<h3>Connecting tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the machine key private and rotate it if you suspect a leak</li>
  <li>Use dedicated service accounts for unattended robots to limit privileges</li>
  <li>Record the tenancy URL in your team wiki so nobody retypes it wrong</li>
</ul>

<h2>After the basics</h2>
<p>Now that your tenant is live you can deploy processes configure queues and set up monitoring. Start small with a proof of concept and use the tenant roles to restrict who can publish or trigger jobs. That way your first automation does not become your team's first outage.</p>

<p>Tip Use a dedicated admin account for tenant setup and separate service accounts for robots. That pattern keeps permissions tidy and makes troubleshooting far less theatrical.</p>
