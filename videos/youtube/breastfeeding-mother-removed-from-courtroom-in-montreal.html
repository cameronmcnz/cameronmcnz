  <p>Yes it happened in Montreal and no it was not subtle. A nursing parent was asked to leave a hearing and the fallout was equal parts legal headache and public outrage. This is not a soap opera plot this is about access to justice and whether a court can balance order with real life needs.</p>

  <h2>Why this matters for access to justice</h2>
  <p>Forcing a parent out of a hearing does more than create an awkward corridor conversation. It can silence testimony delay proceedings and create barriers for people who cannot easily arrange childcare or feeding schedules. When procedure becomes a wall instead of a doorway the whole point of a courtroom gets undermined.</p>

  <h3>Legal background in Canada</h3>
  <p>Canadian law generally protects the right to breastfeed in public. That does not give someone a free pass to disrupt a proceeding. Judges have a recognized duty to manage their courtrooms and to keep hearings orderly. The dispute arises when strict management collides with the practical needs of a nursing parent during a long hearing.</p>

  <h2>Practical steps lawyers parents and court staff can take</h2>
  <p>Spoiler alert These are not magic guarantees but they reduce the chance of a dramatic removal and make hearings run smoother.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notify court staff before the hearing about breastfeeding needs so no one is surprised.</li>
    <li>Request scheduled breaks or ask for a private room to feed if that is permitted.</li>
    <li>Bring a support person if local rules allow them to help with the child or logistics.</li>
    <li>Politely ask permission to breastfeed at counsel table while explaining it will not disrupt the process.</li>
    <li>Document the incident with dates witnesses and any written exchanges in case you need to seek a remedy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If you are removed from court</h2>
  <p>First breathe. Then treat it like any other adverse event. Keep a record of what happened who said what and when. Contact counsel and consider filing a complaint or asking the judge to review the conduct if procedural fairness was affected.</p>
  <p>An informal complaint to court administration or a formal complaint through the provincial complaints process may be options depending on the severity and the jurisdiction. Advocacy groups can also help amplify the issue and push for clearer policies.</p>

  <h2>Courtroom etiquette that actually helps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tell the clerk or the judge in advance about special needs so they can plan breaks.</li>
    <li>Keep any requests short and framed around maintaining the dignity of the parent and the efficiency of the court.</li>
    <li>If you think a removal would prejudice your case ask your lawyer to raise the matter before the hearing starts.</li>
    <li>Remember that reasonable accommodation is not a one way street. Clear communication helps everyone.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Public reaction will always mix principle and emotion. The sensible outcome is clear guidance from courts that preserves decorum while preventing unnecessary barriers to access to justice. That seems fair and not too dramatic which is the exact opposite of what made the news.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip</strong> Tell court staff about breastfeeding needs before the hearing and bring a short written request for accommodation to hand to the clerk or judge if needed.</p>

  <p>Advocates can push for written courtroom policies on nursing parents and judges can adopt pragmatic practices that keep proceedings moving without excluding people from their day in court. That is the goal no one needs applause to do the right thing.</p>
