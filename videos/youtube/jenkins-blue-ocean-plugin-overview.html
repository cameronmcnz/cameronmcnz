<p>Blue Ocean is the cleaner, sassier face for Jenkins when your pipeline diagrams start to look like modern art gone wrong. It is a UI plugin that focuses on pipelines, developer productivity, and hiding the years of Jenkins cruft that used to fill the screen. If you want pipeline visualization that actually helps you find the failure without a scavenger hunt, this is your ticket.</p>

<h2>Features at a glance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Visual pipeline graph that highlights stages and run status so failures are obvious and not mystifying</li>
  <li>Branch and pull request awareness so multibranch pipelines behave like first class citizens</li>
  <li>Guided pipeline editor for Declarative Pipeline syntax to reduce guesswork when editing Jenkinsfile</li>
  <li>Run details and logs attached to stages to speed up debugging and avoid endless scrolling</li>
  <li>Replay and create from run which lets you iterate on fixes without losing context</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works with Jenkinsfile and Multibranch Pipeline</h2>
<p>Blue Ocean plays nicely with Pipeline as Code workflows. Keep your Jenkinsfile in the repo and let the plugin render a modern view of your CI and CD pipelines. Multibranch Pipeline integration means each branch and pull request gets its own visual runs, so developers can see pipeline feedback in a way that makes sense to humans.</p>

<h3>Install and launch</h3>
<p>Install Blue Ocean from the Jenkins plugin manager and accept the dependencies the system suggests. After install use the Blue Ocean entry in the Jenkins menu to open the new UI. No secret rituals required, just a few clicks and you are in the new interface.</p>

<h3>Run details and faster debugging</h3>
<p>Logs are attached to stages which cuts down on unrelated noise. You can jump straight to the failed step, replay a run with changes, or create a branch from a past run. That context keeps the detective work to a minimum when you are on call at 3 a m.</p>

<h2>When to use Blue Ocean and when to stay with classic Jenkins</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Blue Ocean</strong> for onboarding, visual pipeline debugging, and when developers want a less hostile UI</li>
  <li><strong>Use classic Jenkins</strong> when you need advanced configuration or when legacy plugins expect the old UI</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trade offs to know</h3>
<p>Not every plugin or theme built for classic Jenkins will translate to Blue Ocean. Some advanced features remain only in the original UI. Blue Ocean is intentionally focused on making pipelines human readable and low fuss rather than replicating every edge case of the classic interface.</p>

<h3>Quick setup steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open Jenkins and go to Manage Plugins then install Blue Ocean and the listed dependencies</li>
  <li>Use the Blue Ocean entry in the main menu to launch the UI</li>
  <li>Create a Multibranch Pipeline pointing at your repository with a Jenkinsfile in it</li>
  <li>Use the guided editor to build or tweak Declarative Pipeline syntax or keep editing Jenkinsfile in the repo if you prefer code first</li>
  <li>Run the pipeline and use the visual graph and attached logs to diagnose failures quickly</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tip for fewer headaches</h2>
<p>Keep your Jenkinsfile in version control and use Multibranch Pipeline with Blue Ocean for the best feedback loop. Pipeline changes travel with code and developers see visual results without wrestling UI quirks.</p>

<p>In short, Blue Ocean gives you pipeline visualization and developer friendly workflows without pretending to be a full clone of classic Jenkins. Pick the right tool for the job and sleep slightly better at night.</p>
