<h2>Welcome to your slightly less terrifying Git setup</h2>
<p>If you are tired of typing git commands until your fingers fall off or begging teammates to push changes, this guide uses Sourcetree as a friendly git gui and Bitbucket as the remote host to make version control less painful. You will learn how to install and configure Git and Sourcetree, clone a repo, create feature branches, commit with meaning, push to Bitbucket, open pull requests, and survive merge conflicts.</p>

<h2>Install and link Git and Sourcetree</h2>
<p>First install Git on your machine and set your name and email. Then install Sourcetree and add your Bitbucket account in the settings so you are not typing passwords like it is 1999. If you prefer fewer login headaches create SSH keys and add them to Bitbucket. SSH keys save time and dignity when you push repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Quick checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install Git and set git config user.name and user.email</li>
  <li>Install Sourcetree and add your Bitbucket account</li>
  <li>Create or add SSH keys to Bitbucket for painless pushing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clone the repository and start branching</h2>
<p>Use Sourcetree clone to pull the project locally. Choose HTTPS or SSH keys depending on your setup. Once cloned create a feature branch with a clear name. Short and descriptive branch names help your teammates avoid staring blankly at the commit log.</p>

<h2>Make changes and commit like a human</h2>
<p>Edit files in your preferred editor and then stage changes in Sourcetree. Commit with messages that explain why the change was made and not only what changed. Good commit messages are the little diaries future you will thank you for.</p>

<h2>Push and open a pull request</h2>
<p>Push your branch from Sourcetree to Bitbucket. From the Bitbucket web UI open a pull request to request review. A pull request is a polite way to ask for approval rather than hoping for a miracle. Add reviewers, a short description, and link any relevant issue numbers.</p>

<h2>Resolve merge conflicts without panic</h2>
<p>If conflicts appear use Sourcetree to inspect conflicting files or open your preferred merge tool. Test the merged branch locally before merging on Bitbucket to avoid surprise pipeline failures. Remember that small commits and small pull requests reduce conflict drama.</p>

<h3>Best practices that do not suck</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a branch per feature or bug</li>
  <li>Keep commits small and focused</li>
  <li>Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions</li>
  <li>Use CI on Bitbucket to catch issues early</li>
  <li>Test locally before merging</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will move from chaos to a predictable git workflow. Sourcetree gives you a visual grip on branching and bitbucket handles collaboration. Keep practicing and your commit history will stop being a crime scene.</p>
