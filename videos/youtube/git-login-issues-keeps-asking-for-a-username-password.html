<p>If Git keeps begging for a username and password like a needy sitcom character you can make it shut up for good. This guide walks through how to check what helper Git uses now pick a safe helper set your user identity and either store credentials or switch to a personal access token. It is the practical fix for endless prompts without moralizing about your workflow.</p>

<h2>Check which credential helper is active</h2>
<p>First stop guessing and run this to see what helper is configured globally.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper</code></pre>
<p>If the command prints nothing or returns blank then Git has no helper set and will ask every time. If it prints a helper name then you can decide whether to keep it or change it.</p>

<h2>Pick a credential helper that fits your risk tolerance</h2>
<p>Choose the helper that matches your machine and how paranoid you are about plaintext files.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>store</strong> for a simple persistent solution that writes credentials to a file in your home directory. Not encrypted but convenient on a trusted laptop.</li>
  <li><strong>cache --timeout=3600</strong> on Linux for in memory storage that forgets after an hour. Useful if you get nauseous about long lived secrets.</li>
  <li><strong>osxkeychain</strong> on macOS for secure system backed storage managed by the OS keychain.</li>
  <li><strong>manager-core</strong> on Windows for the OS credential manager experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set a global Git identity so commits look like you</h2>
<p>Yes this is about prompts and no this is not the place to use "root" or "admin" as your name. Set a real name and email so commits are labeled correctly and some prompts become less confusing.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code></pre>

<h2>Store credentials or use a personal access token</h2>
<p>If you push over HTTPS GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git operations. Use a personal access token instead of a password when prompted. To save credentials permanently with the simple store helper run this and then do one push where you enter your username and token once.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper store
# then run git push and enter username and personal access token when asked</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer the OS backed helper pick the helper for your system and authentication stays secure without plaintext files.</p>

<h3>Quick examples for choosing a helper</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mac USB coffee machine and you want safety and convenience: <code>git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain</code></li>
  <li>Windows laptop managed by IT and you like GUIs: <code>git config --global credential.helper manager-core</code></li>
  <li>Disposable Linux VM and you do not care about encryption: <code>git config --global credential.helper store</code></li>
  <li>Shared workstation and you want short term memory: <code>git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Test a push and clear stale credentials if needed</h2>
<p>After changing helpers do a normal <code>git push</code> to confirm you no longer get the prompt. If you still see prompts you might have old cached or stored credentials to clear.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the store helper remove the credentials file in your home directory where the helper saved it.</li>
  <li>For OS helpers use the OS credential UI to remove old entries then push again to reauthenticate.</li>
  <li>For cache helper restart the cache or wait for the timeout to expire.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SSH keys are an alternative if you like fewer passwords</h2>
<p>If you want to avoid HTTPS tokens altogether set up SSH keys and use the SSH remote URL. That way Git authenticates with your key pair and your keyboard never cries out for a token again.</p>

<h2>Summary and quick checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check current helper with <code>git config --global credential.helper</code></li>
  <li>Choose store cache osxkeychain or manager-core depending on your OS and threat model</li>
  <li>Set <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code> globally so commits identify you</li>
  <li>Use a personal access token for GitHub HTTPS pushes or switch to SSH keys</li>
  <li>Test with <code>git push</code> and clear old credentials if prompts persist</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will stop typing your username and password like it is 2005. If something still nags at you leave one stubborn log and read it like a detective. Git is not out to get you it just expects you to tell it where to keep the keys.</p>
