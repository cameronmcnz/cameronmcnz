<p>Want to delete a branch in GitLab without causing a small apocalypse on your team</p>
<p>This guide shows the safe ways to delete branches from the GitLab web UI and from the command line with verification steps and a little attitude</p>

<h2>Delete a branch from the GitLab web interface</h2>
<p>Sometimes clicking is faster than typing and less likely to trigger a tragic accidental deletion. Navigate to Project then Repository then Branches. Find the branch you made during a caffeine fueled sprint and click Delete. This is handy for cleaning up branches created by merge requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Branches page in the project</li>
<li>Locate the branch name</li>
<li>Click Delete and confirm</li>
</ol>

<h2>Remove the remote branch with git</h2>
<p>If you prefer the command line or want to script this, push a delete to the remote. Replace origin and feature branch with your actual names</p>
<pre><code>git push origin --delete feature-branch</code></pre>
<p>This tells the remote to drop the branch reference so it no longer shows up for collaborators</p>

<h3>When to force delete</h3>
<p>Use a lowercase d to refuse deletion if the branch has unmerged changes</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d feature-branch</code></pre>
<p>If you accept potential data loss use a capital D to force removal</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D feature-branch</code></pre>

<h2>Clean up the local copy</h2>
<p>After the remote is gone tidy your local repo so your branch list does not read like a historical record of bad ideas</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin
git branch -d feature-branch</code></pre>

<h2>Check protected branches and merge requests</h2>
<p>Protected branches prevent accidental deletion. If a branch is protected unprotect it in Project Settings then try deletion again or ask a project maintainer to help. Also check the merge request setting to automatically delete the source branch on merge if you want less manual cleanup</p>

<h2>Verify the branch is actually gone</h2>
<p>Do not trust the web UI more than your own eyes. Run a fetch prune and list remote branches</p>
<pre><code>git fetch --prune
git branch -r</code></pre>
<p>Or check the remote directly</p>
<pre><code>git ls-remote --heads origin</code></pre>

<h2>Quick recap and naming tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Web UI for quick one off cleanup</li>
<li>git push origin --delete to remove remote references</li>
<li>git branch -d or -D to manage local copies</li>
<li>Check protected branches before you try to delete anything</li>
<li>Use clear prefixes like feature slash bugfix slash hotfix to keep branches sane</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps and you will remove branches like a responsible human instead of a reckless chaos agent</p>
