<h2>Quick truth about docker run and docker compose</h2>
<p>If you are doing containers for a living or pretending to, here is the short version. <strong>docker run</strong> is a fast one off command for launching a single container from the command line. It is great for smoke tests and quick experiments. <strong>docker compose</strong> is a reproducible blueprint for a full stack. It reads a file named <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and brings multiple services up together with a single command like <code>docker compose up -d</code>. One does single containers, the other does multi service sets and shared plumbing.</p>

<h2>Core differences that actually matter</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong> Use <code>docker run</code> for single containers. Use <code>docker compose</code> to coordinate a web server, a database, and whatever other baggage your app insists on carrying.</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration</strong> <code>docker run</code> relies on flags at the prompt. That is fine for one offs. <code>docker compose</code> stores config in YAML so you can commit it to git and pretend you had a plan all along.</li>
  <li><strong>Networking</strong> Compose will create a network so services can talk to each other by name. With <code>docker run</code> you do more manual wiring if you want containers to see one another.</li>
  <li><strong>Scaling</strong> Repeating a run command is a bad workout plan. Compose can scale replicas with a single flag, for example <code>docker compose up --scale web=3</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility</strong> Compose files are shareable and versionable. That makes onboarding less painful and deployments less mysterious.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples you will use and not forget immediately</h3>
<p>Quick test of an nginx image with a name for debugging</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name web nginx</code></pre>

<p>Bring a whole local stack up and detach so you can go back to your life</p>
<pre><code>docker compose up -d</code></pre>

<h2>When to pick which tool</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <strong>docker run</strong> for experiments, demos, and throwaway containers that you will not need to recreate reliably.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>docker compose</strong> for local development, CI test stacks, and small multi service deployments where you want reproducible environment setup.</li>
  <li>Move to a full orchestration platform when you need cross host scheduling, fine grained deploy policies, or cluster level resilience. Compose is not trying to be that boss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical tips from someone who broke networking once</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep your compose files in version control so other humans can see what you did.</li>
  <li>Use environment variable files to avoid hard coding secrets in YAML.</li>
  <li>For local dev mirror production topology but do not expect feature parity without extra orchestration work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short checklist for the indecisive</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Need a quick container now Use docker run</li>
  <li>Need a dev stack that you can share Use docker compose</li>
  <li>Need cluster scheduling Use Kubernetes or another orchestrator</li>
</ul>

<p>Wrap up. Both tools are part of the containerization toolbox. Use the right one for the job, write your compose files like you mean it, and never, ever trust a container name that sounds too clever. This is a docker tutorial and a compose tutorial wrapped in mild sarcasm and useful facts for devops and containerization work.</p>
