<h2>Ready to automate and not lose your mind</h2>
<p>If you want to build RPA projects with UiPath Studio you need an account the installer and a working license. This guide walks you through the setup without the fluff and with just enough sarcasm to keep you awake. It works for Windows and for beginners who like clear steps and short victory dances.</p>

<h2>Create a UiPath account</h2>
<p>Go to the official UiPath portal and sign up with a work or personal email. The Community edition is free for learning and small teams and it unlocks download and license options. Yes it is real and not a trap.</p>

<h2>Download the Studio installer</h2>
<p>Choose the stable release for production work or the preview build if you enjoy living on the edge and testing new features. Save the installer to a folder you will remember. If you do not remember it you will spend five minutes swearing and one hour looking.</p>

<h2>Run the installer as administrator</h2>
<p>Right click the installer and run as administrator. Accept the user agreements and follow the wizard prompts. If Windows asks for permission allow it to make changes or the setup will fail in dramatic fashion and you will feel silly.</p>

<h3>Select your profile and add packages</h3>
<p>Pick Studio for general RPA tasks or Studio Pro for advanced features. Add optional packages like UI Automation and Excel if you plan to automate UI elements or spreadsheets. Those packages save time later and reduce the chances of building fragile workflows.</p>

<h2>Activate a license without tears</h2>
<p>For learning choose the Community edition and follow the activation flow in the License Manager. For enterprise deployments enter your license key or connect Studio to Orchestrator for centralized license management and easier corporate drama handling.</p>

<h2>Open UiPath Studio and start a project</h2>
<p>Launch Studio and create a new project from a template. Explore the Designer panel the Activities pane and the Project panel. Run a small test like a Hello World or a simple type based automation to confirm that runtime and packages are working as expected.</p>

<h3>Quick install checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a UiPath account on the portal</li>
<li>Download stable or preview installer for Windows</li>
<li>Run the installer as administrator and follow the wizard</li>
<li>Choose Studio or Studio Pro and add needed packages</li>
<li>Activate Community edition or enter enterprise license</li>

<p>Final tip Keep the installer and license emails in a folder you can find without invoking ancient rites. Backups are your friend and documentation is the thing you pretend you wrote on purpose.</p>
