<p>If you want a no nonsense central repo that will not accidentally mess with anyone s working copy then a bare Git repository is your friend. It stores all the branches and history but does not have a working tree. That makes it perfect for a shared central repo that teams push to and clone from. Yes it sounds boring and stable on purpose.</p>

<h2>What a bare repository actually is</h2>
<p>A bare repository holds the Git database only. There is no checked out files to trip over. Use it when you want a central remote on a server or a local folder to act like a remote. This is standard version control hygiene if you like avoiding accidental overwrites and weird merge surprises.</p>

<h2>Set up the bare repository</h2>
<p>Make a dedicated folder that will live as the central store. Keeping it local is great for examples and for a quick central repo on a shared machine.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir project.git
cd project.git
git init --bare</code></pre>
<p>The command above initializes a repository without a working tree. That means no files to modify there, only Git objects and refs. Practical and safe.</p>

<h2>Create a normal working repository</h2>
<p>Now create a normal project where developers will edit files and commit. This is what you will push from.</p>
<pre><code>git init myproject
cd myproject
echo "Hello README" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "initial commit"</code></pre>

<h2>Link the working repo to the bare repo and push</h2>
<p>Add the bare repo as a remote and push your branch. If your Git uses main replace master with main in the commands below.</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin ../project.git
git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>Local path remotes are great for examples and for simple central repositories on a single server. For a real server you would use an SSH or HTTP remote instead but the workflow is the same.</p>

<h2>Clone or fetch from the central repo</h2>
<p>Other developers or automation can now clone that central store and get a normal working tree.</p>
<pre><code>git clone ../project.git cloned
cd cloned
git status</code></pre>

<h3>Quick checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use git init --bare to create a bare repository for sharing</li>
  <li>Keep a normal working repository locally to make commits</li>
  <li>Add the bare repo as a remote and push your branches</li>
  <li>Clone the bare repo to get a working tree on other machines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for grown up repos</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep branch protections or server side hooks so people do not push broken code</li>
  <li>Use hooks to enforce checks if you want automation to be mean but fair</li>
  <li>Consider setting up SSH access and proper permissions for multi user servers</li>
</ul>

<p>That is the whole ritual. You made a central repo that will not accidentally stomp a developer s working tree. It is simple and reliable and about as dramatic as a sensible filing cabinet. If you want more advanced server setups look into Git hosting like Gitea or GitLab but for many projects a bare repository is all you need to share code and keep sane version control.</p>
