<p>If you are new to version control and want a less painful way to manage repos this guide will get you from zero to pull request hero. We keep the technical bits accurate and the attitude mildly sarcastic. Expect practical steps for Git with Sourcetree and Bitbucket along with tips that actually save time.</p>

<h2>Why use Sourcetree with Bitbucket</h2>
<p>Sourcetree gives a GUI view of your Git history so you do not have to stare at commit hashes like an oracle. Bitbucket hosts your repositories and handles pull requests for collaboration. Together they make repo management approachable for git beginners while still being powerful for teams doing git branching and code review.</p>

<h2>Set up your tools</h2>
<p>Step 1 Install Git and Sourcetree and configure your identity</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install Git for your OS and then set a global username and email using the terminal with commands such as <code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code> and <code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code></li>
  <li>Install Sourcetree and walk through the initial account setup. It will ask for your Bitbucket account and optionally for authentication keys</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create a Bitbucket repository</h3>
<p>Step 2 Sign up on Bitbucket and create a new repository for your project. Choose private or public depending on your needs and add an SSH key or use HTTPS credentials inside Sourcetree so you do not have to retype ugly URLs.</p>

<h2>Clone and start working</h2>
<p>Step 3 Clone the repository to your local machine. You can use the Clone button in Sourcetree or run <code>git clone &lt;repo-url&gt;</code> in a terminal. The local copy is your playground.</p>

<h2>Day to day workflow</h2>
<p>Step 4 Make changes stage commits and push them. Good habits matter more than hero commits. Keep commits small and write a clear message so future you does not curse present you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the Sourcetree staging area to select hunks or files to commit</li>
  <li>Write messages that explain intent not just state</li>
  <li>Push often to keep the remote up to date</li>
</ul>

<h2>Branching and merging without drama</h2>
<p>Step 5 Create feature branches for new work. Branch names like <code>feature/login</code> or <code>bugfix/cart-quantity</code> communicate purpose. Merge back to main only after testing locally or on a CI environment.</p>
<p>Sourcetree has a visual merge tool which helps when conflicts happen. If you prefer the terminal you can always use <code>git merge</code> or <code>git rebase</code> depending on your workflow.</p>

<h2>Pull requests and code review</h2>
<p>Step 6 Open a pull request on Bitbucket and add reviewers. Use the PR description to explain the why not just the what. This is where collaboration happens and where polite disagreements live.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assign reviewers and add a short checklist if the change needs testing</li>
  <li>Use Bitbucket comments to discuss specific lines instead of sending cryptic chat messages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolve conflicts like a semi competent human</h2>
<p>Step 7 When merge conflicts occur do not panic. Use Sourcetree conflict tools or resolve in a terminal then commit the resolution and push the result. Test the merged code before you declare victory.</p>

<h2>Tips for long term sanity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice on a test repository to build muscle memory</li>
  <li>Adopt a branching strategy that fits your team such as feature branches with pull requests</li>
  <li>Keep commit history readable by avoiding massive catch all commits</li>
  <li>Use SSH keys for smoother authentication and fewer password prompts</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these ordered steps and you will move from git beginners to someone who can manage repo changes without inducing team wide panic. If nothing else you will at least have a GUI that makes rebasing look less like medieval sorcery.</p>
