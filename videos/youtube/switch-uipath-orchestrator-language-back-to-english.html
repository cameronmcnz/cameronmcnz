<h2>When your Orchestrator decides to be mysterious</h2>
<p>UiPath Orchestrator sometimes wakes up and starts speaking a language you do not understand. It is not haunted, it just needs a quick settings adjustment. This short tutorial shows how to switch the Orchestrator language back to English so your menus stop sounding like an encryption challenge.</p>

<h3>What you will need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Access to your Orchestrator account</li>
  <li>Basic user permissions to edit your profile</li>
  <li>An admin on hand if your tenant forces a default language</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step by step to restore English</h2>
<p>Follow these steps and your RPA life will instantly feel more controlled.</p>

<h3>1. Log into UiPath Orchestrator</h3>
<p>Open a browser and go to your Orchestrator URL. Sign in with your credentials and land on the dashboard where the user avatar or your name lives in the corner.</p>

<h3>2. Open your user profile and pick English</h3>
<p>Click the avatar or username to open account settings and look for the language dropdown. Select English from the list. In some versions you might find this option under personal settings or preferences. Yes it can hide like a gremlin, but it is there.</p>

<h3>3. Save and refresh so the change sticks</h3>
<p>Hit save or update in the profile pane. Then refresh the page or press Ctrl F5 to force a full reload. A regular refresh sometimes leaves cached text pretending to be the current language.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting when English still refuses to show up</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the UI stays in the wrong language clear browser cookies and cache and try again</li>
  <li>If multiple users report the same issue the tenant default language might be set by an admin</li>
  <li>Ask an Orchestrator administrator to change the tenant default language to English if that is required</li>
  <li>Use a private browser window to confirm that your changes applied and to rule out cache problems</li>
  <li>Log out and back in after changes if the interface looks stubborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick admin note for tenant owners</h2>
<p>If you manage tenant level settings remember those can override individual profiles. Go to tenant configuration in Orchestrator and set the default language to English if you want everyone to speak the same UI language. This keeps support tickets to a minimum and reduces the number of panicked messages that start with help.</p>

<h2>RPA tips to avoid the mystery language trap</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tell new users where the language selector lives during onboarding</li>
  <li>Document tenant defaults in your internal RPA playbook</li>
  <li>When rolling out changes test in a private window or a staging tenant first</li>
</ul>

<p>There you go. Follow these steps and your Orchestrator will stop trying to be cryptic. If it does not comply then either the cache is lying or someone mischievous changed tenant settings. In either case you now know where to push the buttons and who to ping for backup.</p>
