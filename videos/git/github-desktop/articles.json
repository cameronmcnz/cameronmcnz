    "body": "<p>GitHub Desktop is a free graphical application that simplifies Git and GitHub workflows on Windows and macOS.</p>\n<h2>What the client does</h2>\n<p>Developers use the application to manage repositories without memorizing command line spells. The GUI handles staging, committing, branching, merging and syncing with GitHub. New users gain a visual timeline of changes and a sane place to write commit messages.</p>\n<h2>Common tasks</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Clone a repository</li>\n<li>Make changes and stage files</li>\n<li>Commit with a clear message</li>\n<li>Push and open a pull request</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step details</h3>\n<p><strong>Clone a repository</strong> Use the client to paste a repository URL or sign in to GitHub to see a list. The clone process creates a local copy ready for edits.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage files</strong> Select changed files in the Changes pane to prepare a snapshot. The GUI shows diffs so nothing surprises later reviewers.</p>\n<p><strong>Commit with a clear message</strong> Write a short summary and optional description. Commit history remains readable for teammates and future self.</p>\n<p><strong>Push and open a pull request</strong> Use the Publish or Push button to send changes to GitHub and then open a pull request from the web or from the client when that option appears.</p>\n<p><em>Tip</em> The command line remains useful for complex workflows. Run <code>git status</code> or <code>git rebase</code> when advanced control matters.</p>\n<p>The application serves as a gentle bridge for newcomers and a handy shortcut for experts who prefer not to type every command.</p>",

    "body": "<p>GitHub Desktop is a graphical Git client for Windows and macOS that simplifies cloning committing branching and syncing repositories.</p>\n<h2>Why use GitHub Desktop</h2>\n<p>The client makes common Git tasks accessible without a terminal. Staging and committing use a visual interface. Branching and merging show a clear history. Integration with GitHub makes pull requests and review easier. Terminal purists may scoff but deadlines do not care about snobbery.</p>\n<h2>Key features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clone and create repositories</strong> - Clone a remote repo or initialize a new local project.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual diffs and staging</strong> - See changes and choose which files and hunks to stage before committing.</li>\n<li><strong>Branch management</strong> - Create switch and merge branches with a few clicks.</li>\n<li><strong>Push pull and sync</strong> - Send changes to the server and receive updates from teammates.</li>\n<li><strong>Pull requests</strong> - Open and manage pull requests using a guided workflow.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to get started</h2>\n<p>Install the app from the official site then sign in with a GitHub account. Clone an existing repository through the File menu or create a new repository from the app. Make a branch before making changes. Stage files then write a descriptive commit message and commit. Push the branch to GitHub and open a pull request when ready.</p>\n<h2>Tips and caveats</h2>\n<p>Use the terminal for advanced scripts hooks or complex rebases. The app keeps many workflows simple while preserving the full power of Git for users who want deeper control. Expect fewer typos in commands and more focus on actual development.</p>\n<h3>Quick commands</h3>\n<p>Common commands that correspond to app actions are <code>git clone</code> <code>git checkout -b</code> <code>git add</code> <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code>. Knowing those helps when the GUI needs backup.</p>\n<p>If confusion arises consult the official documentation or use the app's help menu for guided steps.</p>",

Click Raw to view the file source. Right click the page and choose Save Page As or use the browser save command to store the file on the machine. This works best for occasional file grabs.</p>\n<h3>Download a folder or entire repository as a zip</h3>\n<p>On the repository main page click the Code button then choose Download ZIP. Save the archive and extract that package on the local system. This method gives a quick copy of the repository without needing any git setup.</p>\n<h3>Clone the repository with git</h3>\n<p>Open a terminal and run <code>git clone REPO_URL</code>. That command copies the entire repository to the machine and preserves commit history. After cloning use normal file commands to move or copy desired files from the repository folder.</p>\n<h3>Fetch a raw file from the command line</h3>\n<p>For automation grab the raw file link from the Raw view in the browser. Then run a command such as <code>curl -O RAW_FILE_URL</code> or <code>wget RAW_FILE_URL</code> with the chosen raw address. This is handy for scripts that need single file downloads.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If permission errors occur verify repository access and authentication. For private repositories use an authenticated git client or a personal access token with the chosen method. If downloads fail check network rules and retry the chosen approach.</p>",

The computer will receive a zip file of the repository. Unzip the archive to view source files and assets. This is the fastest option when git history is not needed or when the user dislikes terminals.</p>\n<h3>Clone with HTTPS</h3>\n<p>Copy the HTTPS address from the Code menu on the repository page. Run the command <code>git clone REPO_URL</code> in a terminal where REPO_URL is the copied address. The command creates a local copy of the repository including commit history and branches. Use <code>git checkout</code> to switch branches after cloning.</p>\n<h3>Clone with SSH</h3>\n<p>Generate an SSH key on the local machine and add the public key to the GitHub account profile. Copy the SSH address from the Code menu and run <code>git clone REPO_SSH</code>. SSH offers password free access for pushes and pulls when the public key is registered.</p>\n<h3>Use GitHub Desktop or CLI</h3>\n<p>Install GitHub Desktop for a graphical workflow or install GitHub CLI for command line helpers. Run <code>gh repo clone OWNER/REPO</code> to clone with the CLI or use the desktop app to clone with a few clicks. These tools automate some configuration steps and reduce boredom.</p>\n<p>Pick a method that matches the workflow and get to coding.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Install GitHub Desktop on Linux using native packages or Flatpak for a friendly graphical Git client.</p><ol><li>Pick distribution and installation method</li><li>Update system and install required tools</li><li>Choose Flatpak or native package</li><li>Install the chosen package</li><li>Launch the application</li><li>Sign in and verify workflow</li></ol><p><strong>Step 1 Pick distribution and installation method</strong></p><p>Different distributions use different package managers. For Debian and Ubuntu prefer DEB builds or Flatpak. For Fedora use RPM or Flatpak. For Arch use the community repository or Flatpak. Pick a method that matches the level of system neatness desired.</p><p><strong>Step 2 Update system and install required tools</strong></p><p>Keep the package database fresh before installing. On Debian families run <code>sudo apt update</code> then apply upgrades. On Fedora run <code>sudo dnf update</code>. If the Flatpak route is chosen install the Flatpak runtime with the system package manager.</p><p><strong>Step 3 Choose Flatpak or native package</strong></p><p>Flatpak offers sandboxing and easy updates from Flathub. Native packages give tighter integration with the desktop. If sandboxing sounds appealing use Flatpak. If system integration matters choose the distro package.</p><p><strong>Step 4 Install the chosen package</strong></p><p>To install from Flathub run a Flatpak install command such as <code>flatpak install flathub io.github.shiftkey.GitHubDesktop</code>. For a DEB download run <code>sudo dpkg -i github-desktop-deb-file.deb</code> then fix dependencies with <code>sudo apt -f install</code>. For RPM use <code>sudo rpm -i github-desktop-rpm-file.rpm</code> or the distribution installer.</p><p><strong>Step 5 Launch the application</strong></p><p>Start the client from the application menu or run the CLI launcher name for the installed package. Expect a graphical welcome screen that asks for account details and basic configuration.</p><p><strong>Step 6 Sign in and verify workflow</strong></p><p>Connect the GitHub account and clone a small repository to verify commits push and pull as expected. If a credential prompt appears follow the on screen instructions to authorize the client.</p>",

Yes this requires a browser because manual download keeps versions predictable.</p>\n<h2>Step 2 Update package lists</h2>\n<p>Open a terminal and run <code>cd ~/Downloads</code> and <code>sudo apt update</code>. Updating package lists makes sure the package manager can resolve any dependencies during installation.</p>\n<h2>Step 3 Install the package</h2>\n<p>Run <code>sudo apt install ./github-desktop-x.y.z.deb</code> to install the downloaded package directly. If the system refuses the file run <code>sudo dpkg -i github-desktop-x.y.z.deb</code> then follow with the dependency fix command shown next.</p>\n<h2>Step 4 Fix missing dependencies</h2>\n<p>If the package manager reports missing libraries run <code>sudo apt -f install</code>. That command will fetch and install any required libraries and complete the installation process.</p>\n<h2>Step 5 Launch and sign in</h2>\n<p>Open the application menu and start GitHub Desktop or run <code>github-desktop</code> from a terminal. Sign in with a GitHub account and configure the Git name and email when prompted.
