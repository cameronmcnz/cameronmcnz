# Fill out a 'Final' eval for Phase 1

We always ask students to fill out a 'Final Eval' at the end of phase one.

So please think about your journey through the fundamentals of DevOps, all the real-world examples Fox provided, and the videos and extra exercises, and fill out an evaluation.

Choose 'Final Eval', rather than 'daily.'
