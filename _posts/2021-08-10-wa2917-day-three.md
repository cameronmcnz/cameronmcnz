# Today's Agenda: Building Applications

The official topics for today are the Java Builds with Gradle section in the book (Section 6) and the two Gradle labs:

- Lab 4 - Build Java Projects (Do this first)
- Lab 3 - Gradle Tasks (Optional)

## Supplements Slides

We will be supplementing the Gradle slides with a Kahoot quiz.

We will also do the GitFlow and Maven exercise together to demonstrate how Git, Maven and Gradle all work together.
