# Today's Agenda: Building Applications

The official topics for today are the Java Builds with Gradle section in the book (Chapter 3) and maybe even CI/CD (Chapter 4). The two Gradle labs are where you want to be before we hit Jenkins on Thursday.

- Lab 4 - Build Java Projects (I like to do this one first)
- Lab 3 - Gradle Tasks 

## Supplements Slides

We will be supplementing the Gradle slides with a Kahoot quiz.

We will also do the GitFlow and Maven exercise together to demonstrate how Git, Maven and Gradle all work together.

Take a look at these two assignments. We will do them together:

- <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/course/rps-match-git-maven-build.html">Build Exercise I</a> (Maven, Git and Java)
- <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/course/devops-commands.html">Build Exercise I</a> (GitFlow Integration)

For those who really want to hone their Git and GitHub skills, we have this exercise as well:

- <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/2021/08/07/gitflow-maven-java-builds.html">The (Almost) Full GitFlow LifecycleI</a> (GitFlow Integration)
