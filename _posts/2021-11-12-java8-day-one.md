## Exercise on Garbage Collection

Code the SnoopInt and MikeTyson classes from this exercise into a project in Eclise. You can name the project anything you want. Just get these two classes into Eclipse.

Then run the MikeTyson class. Bring up JConsole as it is running and connect to the process running the program.

Monitor the Java heap and memory management. How could you improve the application's performance?
