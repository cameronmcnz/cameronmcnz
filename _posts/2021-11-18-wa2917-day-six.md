# Today's Agenda: SPAs, Microservices and Pipelines

Let's make coders out of all of you DevOps professionals!

Today we'll start with the Roshambo web application. Your assignment is here:

For those who are super clever, you will figure out hot to integrate a RESTful microservice deployed to Amazon's Elastic Container Service into this mix. Guidance is here:

## Lecture

We are going to jump over the optional Jenkins sections and talk about microservices.

-Chapter 14: Microservices Development

As part of the discussion on Microservices, compare the code created in the Roshambo exercise with the same, Servlet and JSP implementation of the rock-paper-scissors app found on GitHub:
