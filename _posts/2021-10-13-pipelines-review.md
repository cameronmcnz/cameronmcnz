We have three labs to go in the Jenkins section:

1. Create a pipeline (Lab 6)
2. Advanced Pipelines with Groovy (Lab 7)
3. Configure Jenkins Security (Lab 8)

Lab Confusion
-------------

Lab 7 (Page 71) has some code that should go all on one line, but spans two lines in the book for formatting reasons. Be careful. This trips up a lot of students.

Today's Agenda
--------------

We talked pipeline's from 9cst/10est to 11cst/12est.

Work on labs 6 & 7, and also factor in a lunch. 

We will return to discuss a bit more about Jenkins at 1pm CST/2pm EST.

I'd like to review these two pipelines together:

1. https://github.com/cameronmcnz/rock-paper-scissors/blob/master/scripted-pipeline
2. https://github.com/cameronmcnz/spock-lizard-docker/blob/master/Jenkinsfile

The remainder of the day after that will be yours to complete the labs and the homework assignments.

Homework Assignments
--------------------

The Phase 1 quiz will be on Friday. But it's been a while since much of the Phase 1 material was presented. So please review it.

GitFlow
-------

There are a few questions on Git and GitFlow on the quiz. Open up this GitFlow Diagram:

And with that GitFlow diagram in hand, see how well you can do on this quiz:

Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------

Read chapter 14 and 15 in the study guide.

Then see how well you'd do on this quiz. After taking the quiz, see if the answers provided make sense to you.

DevOps Questions
----------------

Read through Chapter 1: DevOps Fundamentals in the Guide.

Take note of any terms that are unfamiliar to you. Bring them back to class and ask the instructors to review them.
