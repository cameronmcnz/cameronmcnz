# Getting Started

Two things. First, log into your GitHub account and fork these two repositories:

- Macro-Maven Repo: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git</a>
- SimpleGreeting: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/SimpleGreeting.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/SimpleGreeting.git</a>

Then find the GitHub URL for your fork of the macro-maven repo (the first one you cloned) and copy it so you can use it in the follow-along exercise we'll do in class.

## What is Agile?

The whole discussion of continuous integration and continuous delivery hinges on your understanding of Agile. So let's start the day with a discussion of the Agile Manifesto and Principles. For each principle, I want to know if you think it's actionable, motivational, debatable or just plain rubbish.

## Working with Eclipse

The labs today have you play around in Eclipse, but many of you have never seen Eclipse before. I'd like to do some of the lab from Day 3 with you in Eclipse and show you how much easier Maven, Gradle and Git operations are when performed inside of Eclipse.

## Jenkins, Jenkins, Jenkins!

I'd also like to see if we can build our Macro-Maven application with Eclipse. Are you up for it? Get that Macro-Maven repo forked!!!

Macro-Maven Repo: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git</a>

## Today's Agenda: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

The official topics for today are Continuous Delivery and Jenkins

- Chapter 8: Introduction to CI and CD2
- Chapter 9: Installing Jenkins (Quick Overview)
- Chapter 10: Jenkins Job Types (Time Permitting)

The two labs assigned for the day include:

- Lab 7 - Configure Tools in Jenkins
- Lab 8 - Create a Jenkins Job

## Supplements Slides

We will be supplementing the Gradle slides with a Kahoot quiz.

We will also do the GitFlow and Maven exercise together to demonstrate how Git, Maven and Gradle all work together.

### GitHub, Maven and Eclipse

On Day 3 we did a long exercise with GitFlow, GitHub and Maven. The following video shows you how to import the same GitHub repository used in that example into Eclipse and use the various Eclipse tools to do the exact same thing we did on the command line. Check it out!

The repository used in the example below, which you shoudl probably fork and use, is here:
