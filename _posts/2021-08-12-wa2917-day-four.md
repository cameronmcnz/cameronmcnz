# Getting Started

Two things. First, log into your GitHub account and fork these two repositories:

Marco-Maven Repo: https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git
SimpleGreeting: https://github.com/cameronmcnz/SimpleGreeting.git

Then find the GitHub URL for your fork of the macro-maven repo (the first one you cloned) and copy it so you can use it in the follow-along exercise we'll do in class.

# Today's Agenda: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

The official topics for today are the Java Builds with Gradle section in the book (Section 6) and the two Gradle labs:

- Lab 4 - Build Java Projects (Do this first)
- Lab 3 - Gradle Tasks (Optional)

## Supplements Slides

We will be supplementing the Gradle slides with a Kahoot quiz.

We will also do the GitFlow and Maven exercise together to demonstrate how Git, Maven and Gradle all work together.


### GitHub, Maven and Eclipse

On Day 3 we did a long exercise with GitFlow, GitHub and Maven. The following video shows you how to import the same GitHub repository used in that example into Eclipse and use the various Eclipse tools to do the exact same thing we did on the command line. Check it out!

The repository used in the example below, which you shoudl probably fork and use, is here:
