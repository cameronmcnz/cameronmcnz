# Getting Started

Two things. First, log into your GitHub account (if you have one) and fork these two repositories:

- Rock Paper Scissors Repo:<a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/rock-paper-scissors.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/rock-paper-scissors.git</a>
- Macro-Maven Repo: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git</a>
- SimpleGreeting: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/SimpleGreeting.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/SimpleGreeting.git</a>


Then find the GitHub URL for your fork of the macro-maven repo (the first one you cloned) and copy it so you can use it in the follow-along exercise we'll do in class.

## Working with Eclipse

The next few labs have you play around in Eclipse, but many of you have never seen Eclipse before. I'd like to do some of Exercise II from Day 3, along with some <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/2021/08/07/gitflow-maven-java-builds.html">GitFlow sprinkled in,</a> with you in Eclipse and show you how much easier Maven, Gradle and Git operations are when performed inside of Eclipse.

For reference, check out the <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/2021/08/07/gitflow-maven-java-builds.html">Impossible GitFlow Exercise</a>

## Jenkins, Jenkins, Jenkins!

I'd also like to see if we can build our Macro-Maven application with Eclipse. Are you up for it? Get that Macro-Maven repo forked!!!

Macro-Maven Repo: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git</a>

## Today's Agenda: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

The official topics for today are Continuous Delivery and Jenkins

- Chapter 4: Introduction to CI and CD2
- Chapter 5: Installing Jenkins (Quick Overview)
- Chapter 6: Jenkins Job Types (Time Permitting)

The two labs assigned for the day include:

- Lab 4 - Configure Tools in Jenkins
- Lab 5 - Create a Jenkins Job

## Links

Here are some links we might need:

Macro-Maven NumberGuesser Repo: <a href="https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git">https://github.com/cameronmcnz/macro-maven.git</a>
<a href="https://www.mcnz.com/2021/08/07/gitflow-maven-java-builds.html">GitFlow Exercise</a>
<a href="https://www.mcnz.com/course/rps-match-git-maven-build.html">Drag and Drop Exercise I (Rock Paper Scissors)</a>
<a href="https://www.mcnz.com/course/devops-commands.html">Drag and Drop Exercise II (NumberGuesser)</a>


### GitHub, Maven and Eclipse

On Day 3 we worked with the number guesser example in <a href="https://www.mcnz.com/course/devops-commands.html">Exercise II</a>. The following video shows you how to import the same GitHub repository used in that example into Eclipse and use the various Eclipse tools to do the exact same thing we did on the command line. Check it out!

The repository used in the example below, which you should probably fork and use, is here:
