<h2>Delete S3 Storage Bucket Tutorial</h2>

Just giving a shout out to this video by <a href="http://www.scrumtuous.com/">Scrumtuous's</a> Darcy DeClute on how to remove Amazon S3 buckets.

There's no big trick in terms of how to delete and remove an Amazon S3 bucket from AWS. Just delete all the contents inside and then delete the bucket. Easy-peasy.
