12.4 Facebook conversion pixels

With its help, we can keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement. This enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research. Data collected in this way is anonymous to us, which means we cannot see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You can allow Facebook and its partners to place ads on and outside of Facebook. A cookie can also be saved on your device for these purposes.

12.5 Google Analytics
Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, www.google.com (“Google Analytics” or “Google”). Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.

In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension “anonymizeIp”. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from EU/EEA member states. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly as noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.

Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage.

Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used.

You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

For the cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google has self-certified pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield (https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

12.6 Google Tag Manager (GTM)
Google Tag Manager (GTM”) is a tag management system to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on websites. Tags are small code elements that, among other things, are used to measure traffic and visitor behaviour: to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels; to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups; and to test and optimize websites. GTM makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. We use GTM on our website to include the following tracking tools (as in described in detail this Section 12):

● Google Analytics

● mcnz 

● Facebook Conversion Pixels

● Twitter tailored audience

If you have performed deactivation, GTM takes this deactivation into account. For more information about GTM’s privacy practices can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en and terms of use at https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/.

12.7 Greenhouse Tracking Links

When a job application is submitted through our Greenhouse forms, we capture certain pieces of information (see Section 6 for details). In some marketing campaigns, we use ‘Greenhouse Tracking Links,’ which are URL parameters attached to inbound links to our job posts. When a job application is submitted, Greenhouse captures this parameter and is able to determine which advertising or promotional channel directed you to that job posting. This enables mcnz.com to gauge which channels are most effective.

12.9 LinkedIn Insight Tags

We use the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” of LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 W Maude Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA (“LinkedIn”) on our website. It helps us with in-depth campaign reporting and insights about our website visitors. It can also be used to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our ads on LinkedIn.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to our website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. This data is encrypted, the IP addresses are truncated, and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 90 days.

LinkedIn does not share personal data with us, it only provides aggregated reports about the website audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling us to show personalized ads off our website by using this data, but without identifying the member. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.

All this in accordance with LinkedIn terms and cookie policies.

Our website uses the plugins offered by LinkedIn Slideshare to primarily share presentations and PDFs.

Regarding the use of LinkedIn Slideshare’s plugins (and all plugins offered by LinkedIn products) see the LinkedIn Slideshare’s Privacy Policy stating: “We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology (e.g., our off-site plugins), such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs.

12.14 SoundCloud

SoundCloud is an online audio distribution platform provided by SoundCloud Limited, Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany, c/o JAG Shaw Baker, Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, London W1T 3NF, UK; www.soundcloud.com, (“SoundCloud”). SoundCloud enables its users to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created sounds. On our website we use SoundCloud to share podcasts in posts, and use SoundCloud plugins on our website. When you visit our website, a connection is established with the SoundCloud servers and the plugin is shown. This provides the SoundCloud server with information about the sites you have visited on our website. If you are logged onto SoundCloud as a member, then SoundCloud may automatically assign this information to your personal user account. When you activate the plugin (e.g., by clicking the start button of an audio file), the corresponding information is also assigned to your user account. You can prevent the automatic assignment of this information by logging out of your SoundCloud account and deleting its respective cookies before logging onto our website.

User interaction with the embedded player includes the following functionality:

• Play

• Pause

• duration of playback

• shares made on the podcast

However, all the information will be at an aggregated level and specificity is abstracted out. More information about SoundCloud’s privacy practices can be found at https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy.

12.15 SumoLogic
Sumo Logic is a cloud-based log management and analytics service of Sumo Logic, Inc., 305 Main Street, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA, www.sumologic.com (“Sumo Logic”) that leverages machine-generated big data to deliver real-time IT insights. Sumo Logic uses a piece of software called an “Installed Collector”. An Installed Collector is a Java agent that receives logs and metrics from its sources and then encrypts, compresses, and sends the data to the Sumo service. As its name implies, an Installed Collector is installed in your environment, as opposed to a Hosted Collector, which resides on the Sumo service. After installing an Installed Collector, you add sources, to which the Installed Collector connects to obtain data to send to the Sumo service.

A Sumo source is an object, configured for a specific collector that scans a particular target periodically and sends newly available data to the Installed Collector. SumoLogic collectors are baked into all the server images used by the website and collect the following information.

● IP address;

● date and time;

● session ID;

● Browser and version; and

● OS and version.

The above information is used by developers on mcnz.com’ digital team for debugging/monitoring purposes. Sumo Logic’s privacy policy can be found at https://www.sumologic.com/privacy-statement/.

12.16 Twitter tailored audience
Tailored audiences is the tool of Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, www.twitter.com (“Twitter”), used to target existing users and customers to create remarketing campaigns. Targeting activity can include directly reaching out to users or visitors to the mcnz.com website and campaign pages and/or retargeting previous customer lists. Twitter sets a minimum size limit for a tailored audience to 500 users. If the tailored audience does not match 500 Twitter users, it will display as "audience too small" and will not be available for targeting. Details about Twitter’s policies for conversion tracking and tailored audiences can be found at https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-requirements/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-tailored-audiences.html.

12.17 Urchin Tracking Module (UTM)
UTM tags are not tools. UTM works as a custom URL for marketing campaigns and reports can be viewed in platforms like Google Analytics. UTM tags are appended as part of the visible URL in marketing programs to understand the specific instance of a link. UTM tag reports are observed in Google Analytics/mcnz (see Sections 12.7 and 12.9) for understanding visitors to our website – for example, if they have visited the website, clicked on a link or signed up to a conference/event. These details are collected at an aggregated level. Customizing the URL with UTM tags allows us to better understand the marketing activity, which then allows us to better serve our audience.

The tracking occurs via the UTM parameters that are appended in the URL. When a user clicks an UTM tagged URL, based on the parameters set, we will be able to track from which end source the user has interacted with that URL.

12.18 Wistia/Tencent
Wistia provides software for creating, managing, and sharing videos for business with a customizable player and detailed analytics. Our website uses Wistia, provided by Wistia, Inc., 17 Tudor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA, www.wistia.com (“Wistia”) to host videos. Wistia includes features such as an integrated CDN (content delivery network) for faster loading, and improved quality control depending on the device type and internet speed of the user. It also features the ability to add subtitles for better clarity of the video content. Whenever you interact with any videos on our website, Wistia automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

As stated in Wistia’s privacy policy, Wistia may also use usage information, in identifiable form, to provide video owners with information directly related to the videos that they make available through the website. Such information may include how many and which videos of a particular video owner were watched by a particular user, from where a particular video was watched by a particular user and how many times a particular video was watched by a particular user. For more information about Wistia’s privacy practices can be found at https://wistia.com/privacy.

Tencent is a video player that is similar to Wistia. Our website uses Tencent to host videos for users who live in China since Wistia is blocked there. Tencent’s privacy policy can be found at https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/301/9247.
