# Improved Gitflow Diagram

This is an improved git flow diagram, with all Gitflow branches accounted for, including:

* [master or main](https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main)
* develop or development
* feature
* [hotfix](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitFlow-Hotfix-Branch-Example-Start-Finish)
* bugfix
* support


## Gitflow workflow example

Gitflow is a simple, DevOps enabled (just joking), means for small to medium size teams to work collaboratively on code. It can be used with a local Git repo installed on a shared drive, or with a remote [GitHub or GitLab](https://youtu.be/WQuxeEvaCxs) repository.

For a walkthrough of the Gitflow workflow from [git flow init](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/init-Gitflow-example-workflow-tutorial) to [git release finish](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Gitflow-release-branch-process-start-finish), take a gander at the following tutorial.
