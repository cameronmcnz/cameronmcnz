# Code it in Java

Take a look at this little web application:

https://www.mcnz.com/course/numberguesser.html

Could you code the equivalent in Java? 

In Java it won't look as pretty, but could you get the same basic functionality with the Scanner or JInputPane?

Here are some tips:

- Create a Java class called NumberGuesser
- Add a main method
- Hard code the magic number to 5 for now
- Keep track of the number of guesses
- At the start of the main method, declare the variables you'll need, like the magicNumber and the numberOfAttempts

## Refactor it!

Create a new, static, void method that prints out the results when the game is completed.

You will need to pass in two arguments at least: The magicNumber and the numberOfAttempts

### Randoms

There's a class called java.util.Random that generates random numbers. Any idea how to use it?

### Review

What do you think? What was hard? Where did you get tripped up.
