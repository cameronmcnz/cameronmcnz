# Today's Agenda: Continuous Integration & Jenkins Pipelines

The official topics for today are Continuous Delivery and the Jenkins Pipeline

I think my chapters may be messed up. 

- Chapter 10: Job Types in Jenkins (As a review)
- Chapter 11: The Jenkins Pipeline
- Chapter 12.25: Jenkins Libraries
- Chapter 13: Securing Jenkins
- Chapte 14: Distributed Builds (Optional)

The two labs assigned for the day include:

- Lab 11 - Creation of a Jenkins Pipeline
- Lab 12 - Advanced Pipelines with Groovy DSL (advanced)

## Today's Goals

- Differentiate between a Jenkins Job and a Jenkins Pipeline
- Write a pipeline Git, Maven and Jenkins to continuously build and deploy Java apps
- Understand the role of the Jenkinsfile
- Know where the Jenkinsfile should be located on a Git project
- Be able to contrast continuous integration, delivery and deployment
- Understand the role of the Jenkins shared library
